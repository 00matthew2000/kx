### Decisions ###
#Entente Allies
NEE_entente_allies:0 "Supporting the Entente"
NEE_entente_allies_desc:0 "Our ties to Canada means we are a member of the Entente - whether we like it or not. The British have a great deal of experience and technology, however, which we can use to considerable advantage - though the more we do so, the more we lose legitimacy as a separate and distinct government."

NEE_invite_canadian_advisors:0 "Invite Canadian Advisers"
NEE_entente_military_training:0 "Joint Military Training"
NEE_entente_naval_training:0 "Joint Naval Training"
NEE_Purchase_Weapons:0 "Purchase Canadian Small Arms"
NEE_Purchase_Planes:0 "Purchase Canadian Fighters"
NEE_declare_independence_from_CAN:0 "The Second Declaration of Independence"
NEE_declare_independence_from_CAN_desc:0 "We didn't want it to come to this, but it appears we must: in order for New England to be free, we must declare our independence from [CAN.GetNameDef] and their alliance. If they intend to fight us on this decision, then we must be prepared to meet them in battle."

#Reclaiming America
NEE_reclaiming_america:0 "Reclaiming America"
NEE_reclaiming_america_desc:0 "The Liberty Bell still rings in Boston even as other parts of our fair nation have torn themselves Asunder. Ever since the Canadian intervention which created our provisional government, we have hoped for democracy to win out in the civil war. If that is not the case, then we must steel ourselves to carry the torch for freedom, as the last vestige of democratic America."

NEE_claim_usa_territory:0 "Claim the Mantle of Free America"
NEE_claim_usa_territory_desc:0 "Democratic America has fallen. It now falls on us to claim what is left. For Freedom and the United States!"
NEE_liberate_states:0 "Liberate [From.GetNameDef]"
NEE_liberate_states_desc:0 "As the keeper of American democracy, it falls upon us to take the fight to [From.GetNameDef]!"

#Defence Stratagem A
NEE_Defence_of_New_England:0 "Defence Stratagem A"
NEE_Defence_of_New_England_desc:0 "Our worst fears have come to be as the American Civil War is tearing up the nation from the coasts on the Pacific to the Texan oilfields to the smoking factories of the Great Lakes. We have only succeeded in escaping from the terror by the grace of the British Empire but even our future looks troubled as it is only a matter of time before the ideologically clashing blocs of the South look Northwards, ready to take back what they see as their rightful land.\n\nIt is for them that we must be prepared and defence systems must be created from the Hudson River to the streets of Boston. We may look weak on paper, but it will take every last drop of real American blood to take us down."

NEE_air_defence_of_the_territory:0 "Deploy the Anti-Air Defence System"
NEE_air_defence_of_the_territory_desc:0 "Modern War has shown the value of an air force and the massive destruction it can cause upon the armies of old. Whilst we are desperately trying to keep in the air race, our industrial facilities are far smaller than those of our enemies which has prompted High Command to focus instead on the creation of an elaborate Anti-Air defence system capable of nullifying the air superiority of our opponents."

NEE_hudson_line:0 "Fortify the Hudson Line"
NEE_hudson_line_desc:0 "Flowing down towards the great city of New York, the Hudson river is of great value to any would be defender. Placing §YBunkers§! on its river banks may prove to be of great value in stopping the Southern threat."

NEE_connecticut_line:0 "Fall back to the Connecticut River"
NEE_connecticut_line_desc:0 "Whilst our main defence line lies on the Hudson river, one must always prepare for the unforeseen and as such we should consider creating a line of equal strength behind the Connecticut River. They may have gotten the better of us at the Hudson, but their offence stops here!"

NEE_boston_last_stand:0 "Our Last Stand"
NEE_boston_last_stand_desc:0 "The rivers have been breached and enemy troops are flooding the New Englander countryside. Boston still stands yet general evacuation of its civilian population has already been decreed. "It may seem that the war is turning against us, but the men and women of Boston shall not go gently into the night. We are the last bastion of American democracy; their last hope and it is here that this madness stops!""
NEE_last_stand_tt:0 "3 Divisions of §GNew Englander Volunteers§! will spawn in §YBoston§! to defend the city\n"

#Sway Public Opinion
NEE_Sway_Public_Opinion:0 "Establishing Legitimacy"
NEE_Sway_Public_Opinion_desc:0 "We are a government that has been put into place by a foreign power - and thus many are keen to disregard our right to exist, or to call us traitors for not weighing in on the civil war raging in the rest of the nation. We must combat the opinion that we serve British interests rather than American citizens, and that involves changing attitudes at home. Failure to do so means the eventual dissolution of our government once the civil war is finished - or worse.\n\nCurrent Legitimacy :  §G[?NEE.NEE_legitimacy]§!"

NEE_national_propaganda_campaign:0 "Organise a Propaganda Campaign"
NEE_national_propaganda_campaign_desc:0 "Billboards, Radio Commercials, Newspaper Ads and much more, all will be pushed down the people’s throats in the hopes of conveying our message."

NEE_presidential_goodwill_tour:0 "Hold a Presidential Goodwill Tour"
NEE_presidential_goodwill_tour_desc:0 "Even as our propaganda ministry works around the clock, the man on the street remains unconvinced that actual power is wielded in Boston and sees the "president" as nothing more than a Canadian sock puppet happily following all orders from Ottawa. By touring the president and the elected cabinet around New England we hope to further convince the people that their real president and leader is very much [NEE.GetLeader]"

NEE_bribe_foreign_press:0 "'Motivate' the Foreign Press"
NEE_bribe_foreign_press_desc:0 "Journalists from all sides of the world keep having this annoying habit of reporting news within our nation as matters of the 'New Englander' state with socialist-aligned papers even going so far as calling us the Canadian Province of New England. This will no longer do for we will not be trifled with and they shall soon recognise that the only true American nation is ours. For now, however we'll have to be content with sliding some money towards the largest troublemakers and politely requesting that they call us the United States of America."

NEE_foreign_representation:0 "Increase Foreign Representation in R&D"
NEE_foreign_representation_desc:0 "The war may be raging harder than ever before but American scientists are still working in the labs and engineering facilities of the Ivy League universities. Let's make it clear that [Root.GetNameDef] has the wherewithal to innovate and stand on its own among the world leaders."

NEE_labour_relation_act:0 "Pass the Labour Relation Act"
NEE_labour_relation_act_desc:0 "A key source of the chaos to the south was the unmitigated exploitation of the working class by the elite. We need to avoid this occurring here by protecting workers' rights"

#Freedom Fliers
NEE_Dropping_Propaganda:0 "The 'Freedom Fliers'"
NEE_Dropping_Propaganda_desc:0 "The airplane has not only revolutionised the way we travel, transport goods or even wage warfare but also the ways with which we can spread our messages. Through the use of balloons, bombers and even just your regular fighter, the Freedom Fliers initiative has been tasked with flying deep over enemy territory to wage not the physical but the psychological war hoping to disrupt the minds of those that may not fully be on board with the nation they are fighting for."

NEE_Choosing_our_Propaganda:0 "Choosing our Message"
NEE_Choosing_our_Propaganda_desc:0 "Even though there is an agreement that the Freedom Fliers should depart for the skies, dispute still rules in the ministry of propaganda as the search for the 'perfect' message knows no end and designers are sent back to the drawing board."

NEE_prop_choice_made:0 "We have chosen our §YMessage§!"

NEE_For_Home_and_Fatherland:0 "Fly over §Y[USA.GetNameWithFlag]§!"
NEE_Figthing_the_Reds:0 "Fly over §Y[CSA.GetNameWithFlag]§!"
NEE_Down_with_the_Traitors:0 "Fly over §Y[TEX.GetNameWithFlag]§!"
NEE_Not_My_President:0 "Fly over §Y[CAL.GetNameWithFlag]§!"

#Liberty Ship Project
NEE_Liberty_Ship_Program:0 "Liberty Ship Program"
NEE_Liberty_Ship_Program_desc:0 "With war on the European continent inevitable and with the Ententes ambitions to execute the largest naval operation in the history of mankind, the dockyards of New England are working overtime to meet the increasing needs of the alliance. To further boost our output, a centralised construction scheme has been created by the government to guide the further expansion of these shipyards."

### FOCUS TREE ###
NEE_Legitimate_America:0 "America's Darkest Hour"
NEE_Legitimate_America_desc:0 "With the rest of the United States consumed by war, New England has managed to become a safe harbour in a storm of chaos. We must reassure those in our borders that the provisional government is their only hope of freedom and safety."

NEE_Land_of_the_Free:0 "Land of the Free, Home of the Brave"

NEE_Reassure_Financial_Institutions:0 "Reassure Financial Institutions"
NEE_Reassure_Financial_Institutions_desc:0 "Many international firms are (understandably) terrified of losing their investments in America. We must reassure them that New England, at least, is a safe place to do business and make a profit."

NEE_International_Recognition:0 "Seek International Recognition"
NEE_International_Recognition_desc:0 "Some may see our government as illegitimate, elites more concerned with profits than the welfare of our people and existing only because we have been propped up by the Canadians. We must present ourselves to the world as a true government. What happens once the civil war ends is another matter entirely."

NEE_Townhall_Democracy:0 "Townhall Democracy"
NEE_Townhall_Democracy_desc:0 "Democracy works best on the local level. We must ensure that, even in this time of chaos, people are still able to participate in democracy and feel like their voice is heard by the provisional government."

NEE_Public_Opinion_Support_desc:0 "Through films, song, art, and all the traditional means of propaganda, we will establish confidence in the provisional government's ability to both govern and do what's in the best interests of our American citizens."

NEE_Declare_Independence:0 "Demand Home Rule"
NEE_Declare_Independence_desc:0 "The New England provisional government was created by Canada, it's true, but we are established enough now that it's time we stood on our own feet. Unless the Canadian reason for intervention is not what they suggested, and they have more nefarious aims...?"

NEE_Battleline_of_Freedom:0 "Battleline of Freedom"
NEE_Battleline_of_Freedom_desc:0 "We are surrounded by history. From the battlefields of Lexington and Concord, where the first shots of the revolution were fired, to the hallowed halls of Boston. We must treasure and celebrate our past as the birthplace of American democracy. The border is drawn at the state of New York and we shall give our best to keep the ideological extremes of the South outside of our territory."

NEE_WASP:0 "Deploy the WASPs"
NEE_WASP_desc:0 "The birthplace of American feminism lies in Seneca, in upstate New York. We need to ensure that patriotic women can contribute to the war effort just as their male counterparts. The WASP initiative, aimed at utilising women in the air force, has already shown promise and its full implementation will both serve as a valuable asset to our thinly-stretched forces."

NEE_US_Navy:0 "New Englander Navy"
NEE_US_Navy_desc:0 "Only a few ships, and even fewer sailors, remain under the provisional government's control. We need to take stock of our maritime situation."

NEE_Liberty_Ships:0 "Liberty Ships Dock Project"
NEE_Liberty_Ships_desc:0 "With war in Europe inevitable, and with the Entente's ambitions to execute the largest naval operation in the history of mankind, the dockyards of New England are working overtime to meet the increasing needs of the alliance. To further boost our output, a centralised construction scheme has been created by the government to guide further expansion of these shipyards."

NEE_destroyer_effort:0 "Destroyer Effort"
NEE_destroyer_effort_desc:0 "Destroyers will be able to protect our convoys from both submarines and aerial attacks. They are also cheap, and quick to build. We should invest in destroyer construction at once."

NEE_submarine_effort:0 "Salmon Class Submarines"
NEE_submarine_effort_desc:0 "An incremental improvement over the previous Porpoise class, they will be the first American submarine class to achieve 21 knots with a reliable propulsion plant, allowing them to operate with the Standard-type battleships of the surface fleet. Their range of over 11.000 Nautical miles also further makes them the prime submarine in operations from the Atlantic to the Pacific."

NEE_light_cruiser_effort:0 "Cruiser Effort"
NEE_light_cruiser_effort_desc:0 "Cruisers are a sound investment for a mid-range naval power like ourselves, and they will be a valuable asset to the overall Entente navy as well."

NEE_Colombia_Gem_of_the_Ocean:0 "Colombia, Gem of the Ocean"

NEE_US_Airforce:0 "New England Air Force"
NEE_US_Airforce_desc:0 "Although we have little experience with the use of aircraft in military operations, the Weltkrieg has shown its crucial role on the battlefield and years of continued research and development in the field has led to the creation of our own air force. Although untested in battle, our manufacturers have guaranteed us that America has and will always have the best aircraft in the world."

NEE_Air_Defence_Command:0 "Establish Air Defence Command"
NEE_Air_Defence_Command_desc:0 "Our planes need air bases from which to train. While New England's rough terrain makes finding suitable sites difficult, several have been identified around West Point. We should begin construction at once."

NEE_Paladin_Fighter:0 "Curtiss P-40 Warhawk"
NEE_Paladin_Fighter_desc:0 "Designed as a single-engined, single-seat, all-metal fighter and ground-attack aircraft with the framework of the P-36 Hawk, the P-40 is not only a more capable aircraft but also quick to manufacture and capable of fighting in all terrains."

NEE_B25_Bomber:0 "B-24 Bomber"
NEE_B25_Bomber_desc:0 "The old adage that 'the bomber will always get through' might not be true anymore. But we need to ensure our bombers are up to modern standards and what design would better to suit these standards than the B-24?"

NEE_P51_Mustang:0 "Curtiss XP-62"

NEE_ISAC_Equipement:0 "ISAC Equipment Reliance"
NEE_ISAC_Equipement_desc:0 "The Canadian ISAC initiative has established itself as a veritable authority in the field of armament research and its production capacity and technological knowhow still leave us far behind. It may be wiser to benefit from their expertise than stubbornly throw ourselves alone at the troubles modern war seems to bring."

NEE_Self_Reliance:0 "Self-Reliance"
NEE_Self_Reliance_desc:0 "We are an American nation, not some Canadian puppet, and allowing ourselves to become too complacent in arms development by benefitting from Canadian expertise will become a problem should we one day be forced into combat with the rest of America and find ourselves technologically behind our northern allies."

NEE_Infrastructure_Act:0 "Pass the Infrastructure Act"
NEE_Infrastructure_Act_desc:0 "Rough winters and a lack of public funding have destroyed our infrastructure. Trains are late, roads are full of potholes, and people are angry. Comprehensive investment in infrastructure will placate the population and give the unemployed a well-paying job."

NEE_bureau_of_industry:0 "Bureau of Central Planning"
NEE_bureau_of_industry_desc:0 "Public works programs are a good way of ensuring that unemployment does not breed radicalism. The new Bureau of Central Planning should therefore be created to ensure a central authority in guiding our people away from the streets and into the factories and construction facilities, all for a better tomorrow!"

NEE_Synthetic_Oil:0 "Combat the Petroleum Deficit"
NEE_Synthetic_Oil_desc:0 "The dire fuel situation of the Entente is forcing our hand in the ever-continuing search to find a reliable solution to the issue. Researchers from all across the British Empire and now also the Ivy League are hard at work to ensure that New England will not fall due to scarcity alone."

NEE_Maine_Steel:0 "Steel Mills of Maine"
NEE_Maine_Steel_desc:0 "Maine is full of valuable mineral deposits. We must ensure that they are accessible for mining through the development of new resource extraction technology."

NEE_Minutetank:0 "The 'Minutetank'"
NEE_Minutetank_desc:0 "Tanks and other armoured vehicles have proven themselves the future for warfare and it seems only fair that we should devote ourselves to their development as well if we wish to remain competitive. In honour of the Minutemen of the American Revolution, the project has been codenamed 'Minutetank'."

NEE_Settlement_Movement:0 "Settlement Movement"
NEE_Settlement_Movement_desc:0 "The Settlement Movement of the 1920s tried to bring the rich and poor of society together in both physical and social proximity. Its main object was the establishment of 'settlement houses' in poor urban areas, in which volunteer middle-class 'settlement workers' would live, hoping to share knowledge and culture with, and alleviate the poverty of, their low-income neighbors. We must bring back this program!"

NEE_Electrification_Effort:0 "Electrification Effort"
NEE_Electrification_Effort_desc:0 "Many of our rural communities lack electricity, especially in Vermont and New Hampshire. We need to ensure that all citizens have access to it."

NEE_Ivy_League_Expansion:0 "Expand the Ivy League"
NEE_Ivy_League_Expansion_desc:0 "Two out of the three 'Big Ivies' - Harvard and Yale - lie under our control. We must support the scholars at these and high-level universities in the development of computers and other industrial technology."

NEE_American_Capitalism:0 "American Capitalism"
NEE_American_Capitalism_desc:0 "Capitalism is the lifeblood of America. The traitors in the rest of the country seek to destroy it, and with it the American way of life. We must preserve it at all costs."

NEE_Smith_and_Wessons:0 "Funds for Smith & Wesson"
NEE_Smith_and_Wessons_desc:0 "Founded in 1852, the small arms manufacturer Smith & Wesson is the prime example of the genius of New Englanders in the weapons business. Further funding and the expansion of their production facilities shall ensure that our troops have sufficient weapons to back up their claims on the United States."

NEE_Lowel_Munition_Factory:0 "Lowell Munition Factory"
NEE_Lowel_Munition_Factory_desc:0 "To assist our weapons manufacturer Remmington and to provide a steady supply of ammunition for our troops on the front, plans have been drawn up to fund the creation of a new munition plant in the town of Lowell, Massachusetts which has been hit hard by the Great Depression leaving 40% of the population without jobs."

NEE_Reestablish_Minutemen:0 "Re-establish the Minutemen"
NEE_Reestablish_Minutemen_desc:0 "Governor Long claims to have inherited the legacy of the Minutemen, but we are the true successors to those who stared down the British on the fields of Lexington and Concord and so shall we again oppose his troops when they come for us."

NEE_long_range_patrol:0 "Long Range Patrol"
NEE_long_range_patrol_desc:0 "In cooperation with the armies of the Entente, it has become apparent that we should focus on a small but powerful striking force capable of dealing a massive blow straight in the middle of enemy territory instead of slowly pushing on an open front."

NEE_marines:0 "US Marine Corps"
NEE_marines_desc:0 "Semper Fidelis means 'always loyal'. The Marine Corps will always be a bastion of American liberty and democracy and help spread these freedoms around the world. We need to enlarge the Marine Corps and ensure that they are able to project our power around the globe."

NEE_Urban_Combat_Training:0 "Urban Combat Training"
NEE_Urban_Combat_Training_desc:0 "In the alleyways of NYC and the avenues of Washington DC will the Civil War be fought, and our troops will need to be prepared to excel on these fronts as this is no ordinary war and no ordinary tactics will suffice if we wish to come out on top."

NEE_Behind_Eneny_Lines:0 "Behind Enemy Lines"
NEE_Behind_Eneny_Lines_desc:0 "Just like John Brown, we will send patriots south to spread the word of the coming liberation. They will inspire rebellions and turn people against the tyrants that rule them. When the time comes, they will help bring down the false government!"

NEE_Underground_Railroad:0 "Establish the Underground Railway"
NEE_Underground_Railroad_desc:0 "Few are happy with the government to the south. Just like our grandfathers did in the era of slavery, we will assist those persecuted by the southern traitors in coming north, to freedom."

NEE_Enfield_Imports:0 "Enfield Import Program"
NEE_Enfield_Imports_desc:0 "Our factories are producing as quickly as we can but the sheer size of the conflict is forcing us towards the old stockpiles of the Entente whose reserves of old weaponry are far larger than our own and who will surely help us out...for a price."

NEE_defensive_in_nature:0 "Defensive in Nature"
NEE_defensive_in_nature_desc:0 "We are outnumbered and outgunned on all sides by the extremist factions to our South and it would thus be very unwise to strike first. We should build up our defences and let them come to us!"

NEE_Entrenchement_Tactics:0 "Entrenchment and Redeployment Tactics"
NEE_Entrenchement_Tactics_desc:0 "America is a geographically diverse country, with some areas being difficult to supply and defend. We need to ensure our divisions have the proper logistics capabilities and that they are capable of establishing quick defences anywhere in our great nation."

NEE_Forest_Rangers:0 "Green Mountain Boys"
NEE_Forest_Rangers_desc:0 "The hills of Vermont and New Hampshire have always had a strong military tradition, dating back to the Green Mountain Boys of the Revolutionary War. Lead by Ethan Allen, a charismatic leader who could supposedly throw a bag of salt over his shoulder with his teeth, they struck fear into British supply trains. We should seek to emulate them in our own war against tyranny."

NEE_Defence_Stratagem_A:0 "Deploy Defence Stratagem A"
NEE_Defence_Stratagem_A_desc:0 "Defence Stratagem A or America is the prime directive of our military high command as they are planning to make New England an impregnable fortress capable of resisting anything our enemies may throw at her. The spirit of freedom shall endure and so shall her followers!"

NEE_A11_Mathilda:0 "A11 'Mathilda' Cooperation"
NEE_A11_Mathilda_desc:0 "The engineers and scientists of the British Empire have long been experimenting with new ways of mechanised warfare and a joint tank development program by the entire Empire has combined its forces to design the so called A11 'Mathilda' tank. Our knowledge of tank development is lacking but they have granted us the opportunity to join them in designing and creating this new vehicle."

NEE_Arsenal_of_Democracy:0 "Arsenal of Democracy"
NEE_Arsenal_of_Democracy_desc:0 "From the smoky factories of Buffalo to the harbours of Rhode Island and Connecticut, our military industrial complex is a veritable player on the world stage and it shall be these weapons that will liberate Europe from the iron yoke of the Syndicalist menace."

NEE_new_england_nationalism:0"New England Alone"
NEE_new_england_nationalism_desc:0"It is time to cast ourselves from the fallen states. We have no claims to these lands, nor have we ever. We are New England, a proud nation independent from the rest of America. We have our own culture, people and heritage, and once the day comes when America tries to take us back, we will resist to the end; as we are separate from America now and forever. "

NEE_canadian_freindship:0 "Canadian Friendship"
NEE_canadian_freindship_desc:0 "If we are to contribute to the Entente we must reinforce our friendship with the Canadians. They helped liberate us after all, so we should reinforce our friendship with them. This will also help improve our trade relations with them."

NEE_irish_freindship:0 "Friendship with the Irish"
NEE_irish_freindship_desc:0 "We have a large Irish diaspora population within our country as many settled in our country, notably in the city of Boston. We should work to improve the relations between our two countries. By improving relations we can keep them on our good side and perhaps even help convince them to join the Entente to oppose Syndicalism."

NEE_claim_nyc:0 "Claim New York City"
NEE_claim_nyc_desc:0 "It is time to claim the city of New York City and reunite the city with the rest of the province of New York. The people of the city will welcome us as liberators and protectors when we arrive. This will of course give us the important city of New York for the Commonwealth of New England."

NEE_new_england_dominion:0 "New England Dominion"
NEE_new_england_dominion_desc:0 "With the claiming of New York City, several political leaders have suggested that we go back to the border plans of the Dominion of New England. By this they mean moving south and liberating New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Such a move is controversial but the industrial strength of the two states would be a great boon to the Commonwealth of New England."

NEE_canadian_modled_government:0"A Canadian Modeled Government"
NEE_canadian_modled_government_desc:0"Canada is our greatest ally, and we should adopt our government on their lines. Instead of a President we should have a Prime Minister, instead of a Senate we will have a House of Representatives. We shall be a proper state, modeled on the superior British style of government. With this system in place, New England will be a bastion of peace, stability and freedom; and all in Canada will look upon us kindly. "

NEE_new_new_england:0"Our own Federation"
NEE_new_new_england_desc:0"We will not change our system of governance dramatically; the current system suits us well and will continue to do so in the future. A federal system of our 6 states will ensure fairness, equality and freedom, and will keep New England out of Canada or America’s thumb. "

NEE_iamprovidence_desc:0 "I am Providence, & Providence is myself—together, indissolubly as one, we stand thro’ the ages; a fixt monument set aeternally in the shadow of Durfee’s ice-clad peak!  It is New England I must have—in some form or other."
NEE_destroy_the_cult_of_the_past:0 "Destroy the Cult of the Past"
NEE_destroy_the_cult_of_the_past_desc:0 "The new order has taken hold, yet a few hold-out "patriots" nostalgic for the days of the republic remain. As for these republicans -- how can one regard seriously a frightened, greedy, nostalgic huddle of tradesmen and lucky idlers who shut their eyes to history and science, steel their emotions against decent human sympathy, cling to sordid and provincial ideals exalting sheer acquisitiveness and condoning artificial hardship for the non-materially-shrewd, dwell smugly and sentimentally in a distorted dream-cosmos of outmoded phrases and principles and attitudes based on the bygone agricultural-handicraft world, and revel in, consciously or unconsciously, mendacious assumptions such as the notion that real liberty is synonymous with the single detail of unrestricted economic license or that a rational planning of resource-distribution would contravene some vague and mystical 'American heritage'... utterly contrary to fact and without the slightest foundation in human experience? Intellectually, the Republican idea deserves the tolerance and respect one gives to the dead."
NEE_see_it_all_burn:0 "See it all Burn"
NEE_see_it_all_burn_desc:0 "If religion were true, its followers would not try to bludgeon their young into an artificial conformity; but would merely insist on their unbending quest for truth, irrespective of artificial backgrounds or practical consequences. Many falsely equate our movement to revive the Anglo spirit of America to the religious fundamentalist or occult mystics that have taken root in the darkest corners of our nation. There beliefs will ultimately betray our movement, and we must work diligently to utterly shatter any semblance of religious authority within our ranks and prevent these misguided simpletons from gaining too much power within our ranks."
NEE_establishdeltagreen:0 "Establish Delta Green"
NEE_establishdeltagreen_desc:0 "Deception is a right. Truth is a privilege. Innocence is a luxury. Noisome monstrosities lurk in the dark corners of the Earth. Syndicalists, the saboteurs of civilization, hide within our towns and cities. If Providence is to protect New England, he needs men who will do what is necessary to protect it. For that purpose, he has founded Delta Green, an agency with far broader authority than the old FBI."
NEE_the_new_gods:0"The New Gods"
NEE_the_new_gods_desc:0"In search of the truth the hopeful zealot goes, but all the sadder turns, the more he knows. The current religious and mystical order in the Americas reveals not life lessons and guidance but miserable platitudes that ultimately leaves the soul unsatisfied. The Judeo-Christian God as we know it offers us no answers. Providence, anointed by the one true God, has seen the dark universe yawning. Where the black planets roll without aim. Where they roll in their horror unheeded, without knowledge lustre, or name. By studying his mythos and anthropomorphizing his characters into a form of occult study, we can perhaps clean a small sliver of his endless dark wisdom."
NEE_absorb_the_cults:0"Absorb the Cults"
NEE_absorb_the_cults_desc:0"Within New England are many who see Lovecraft’s works not as the word of a writer, but as the word of God Himself. And they hold his work in higher regard than the Quran, the Talmud, or the Bible. And this particular subset of society has taken to forming cults around Providence and his works, as they believe that the gods are speaking through Lovecraft and communicate through his infinite wisdom. Even though Providence knows that he crafts works of fiction, and that these cults are comprised of insane lunatics; he cannot deny their devotion to him. Ensuring their loyalty is of the upmost importance, and once they are integrated into our nation they can adequately fit in Lovecraft’s new Order."
NEE_warrior_society:0"Warrior Society"
NEE_warrior_society_desc:0"In order to defend the movement from the world beyond our serine grace it is our utmost duty to stand guard, ever vigilant, side by side with our Canadian allies. Every citizen of military age must make it their sworn duty to prepare themselves for the final struggle against the darkness and barbarities of syndicalism and foreign threat alike. Bury’d now are the hatreds of subject and King, And the strife that once sunder’d an Empire hath vanish’d. With the fame of the Saxon the heavens shall ring As the vultures of darkness are baffled and banish’d; And the broad British sea, Of her enemies free, Shall in tribute bow gladly, Columbia to thee: For the friends of the Right, in the field side by side, Form a fabric of Freedom no hand can divide!"
NEE_destroy_the_irish:0"The Irish Scourge"
NEE_destroy_the_irish_desc:0"Curley and his allies have plunged New England into Anarchy. We can not let these Irish Monsters terrorize our proper English Nation.

Long Live Lovecraft, and long live the WASPs"
NEE_secure_vermont:0"The Vermont Campaign"
NEE_secure_vermont_desc:0"Vermont is home to Aiken, as well as other disgusting Socialist Resistance. With Curley gone Vermont is now the epicenter of resistance to Lovecraft’s rule. But, with the Canadians on the border and loyal legions of Lovecraftian troops, we can engage in a mighty offensive in Vermont that will split the Rebel Forces in twain. “
NEE_secure_new_hampshire:0"Secure New Hampshire"
NEE_secure_new_hampshire_desc:0"Now that Vermont has fallen, the time has come to drive east. The next logical place to mount an offensive would be the state of New Hampshire. The Governor of the state, Styles Bridges is less than welcoming to Lovecraft’s rule and has actively resisted the rule of the Providence Circle and the Loyal Coalition. We must use our loyal troops to take them out, even though Canada is less supportive of this campaign. "
NEE_secure_maine:0"Secure Maine"
NEE_secure_maine_desc:0"Now that the rebel forces have been split, the chips start to fall away. The final pocket of resistance in the East is in the state of Maine. Governor Lewis O. Barrows has declared Maine separate for the rest of New England and rallied the State’s national guard to his side along with several defectors and Syndicalist Militias. They must be taken out, and the job won’t be too hard considering the fact that they are cut off from the rest of the nation, and Canada has pledged their full support. "
NEE_secure_new_york:0"Secure Upstate New York"
NEE_secure_new_york_desc:0"The Final Rebel Holdout is the remnants of the state of New York. The upper part of the State was practically abandoned once Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia declared that New York City was no longer part of the State of New York. Ever since then, the state has been wracked with lawlessness until Canada came and restored order. Now, they are the last pocket of resistance, with Governor Herbert Lehman and the tattered remnants of the Rebel Forces. They are close to collapse, and once we begin our mighty offensive to Albany the last holdouts will surely crumble."

### Flavor Events ####

newengland.40.t:0 "The Great New England Hurricane of 1938"
newengland.40.d:0 "What was first considered a non-issue, the Yankee Clipper Hurricane arrived on Long Island September 21st and would only a few hours later turn out to be largest Hurricane to set foot in New England since the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635.\n\nMoving North from Long Island to Connecticut, Rhode Island and up through Vermont the storm cost the lives of close to 700 people. By the end of the devastation over 57,000 homes were destroyed or damaged and road networks all across the New England region lay in tatters with projections estimating that it would take us months or even years just to re-open them to traffic."
newengland.40.a:0 "God save us all."

newengland.41.t:0 "Road integration with Canada?"
newengland.41.d:0 "As we continue building up our economy and expanding the road network, the question arose of which direction we should drive on. While the custom in America has always been to drive on the right Canada has, since the British revolution in 1925, driven on the left.\n\nSome political leaders have suggested that we switch to driving on the Left in an attempt to better integrate our road network into the Canadian one whilst others of course wish to stay driving on the right to further amplify that New England is not a British Dominion."
newengland.41.a:0 "We shall adapt to the British model."
newengland.41.b:0 "American cars drive on the side of Freedom!"

newengland.42.t:0 "Royal visit to New England"
newengland.42.d:0 "King-Emperor Edward the 8th and his wife Isabelle of Orleans have arrived in Boston today to mark improved ties between New England and Canada. This is the first time that a reigning British monarch has visited Boston in its entire history. As to be expected large jubilant crowds of New Englanders have come out to catch a sight of the King and Queen of the British Empire. The visit was more then just seeing the sites of the sites for they also came to discuss politics with the various leaders of note in New England."
newengland.42.a:0 "Welcome to Boston!

### Underground Railroad ###
newengland.50.t:0 "The Underground Railroad"
newengland.50.d:0 "Established in the 1700s, the first Underground Railroad served as a network of secret routes with as purpose to clandestinely transport Afro-American slaves from the Thirteen Colonies into Canada where slavery was already abolished.\n\nWith the American Civil War tearing apart households across the Americans and ideological strive leading to the forced expulsion or sometimes even massacre of Americans, our government has reignited the old "Railroad" and has with the aid of locals on both sides of the border re-established the network with the hopes of safely transporting refugees to our little nation."
newengland.50.a:0 "There is only so much we can do though..."

#CSA
newengland.51.t:0 "The Lake Erie Migration Crisis"
newengland.51.d:0 "The war has only been raging for a few weeks now as opposing forces fight it out around the Great Lakes. As comrade shoots comrade and the battlelines shift in both directions, one can not forget the tremendous loss of civilian life.\n\nOften caught in the midst of battle, decimated in bombing raids or executed by fanatics of either side, these people have been fleeing en-masse from the fighting towards our nation. As the land route is becoming more dangerous by the day, vast swathes of shaky tubs have been spotted on Lake Erie in a desperate attempt to reach our peaceful sanctuary. The condition of these rafts is often so dire that many don't even make it across the border, let alone into our safe hands. Relief organisations such as United America and the Red Cross have flocked to the coastline of the lake to help those that survive the perilous journey, often undertaken under cover of the night. They now ask that the government provides them with more means to rescue those coming across and to sweep our side of the lake for survivors.\n\nPragmatists in the Army however have seen an opportunity in this Great Migration to smuggle weaponry and equipment from the CSA into our hands. They propose that we send covert agents to Detroit and Cleveland who will then smuggle the goods on the refugee rafts towards our patrol boats."
newengland.51.a:0 "Allow covert operatives to establish a base on Pelee Island."
newengland.51.b:0 "We can not put the lives of innocents in danger with our schemes!"

newengland.52.t:0 "Successful Smuggling Operation on Lake Erie"
newengland.52.d:0 "Tucked away beneath sheets of linen and between the clothes of refugees, our covert operatives on the far side of Lake Erie have been able to successfully smuggle small arms, munition, medical supplies. Even heavier equipment such as artillery shells and dismantled mortars have been carried across by efforts of our, American, people being nothing short of heroic. Thus far the Syndies suspect nothing but it would seem only natural that one day our luck will run out..."
newengland.52.a:0 "Piece by piece we pick away at the carcass"

newengland.53.t:0 "Smugglers apprehended!"
newengland.53.d:0 "Our good fortune couldn't last and yesterday was once again further proof of this. Although nothing seemed out of the ordinary on the smuggler boats, a slight deviation on the schedule of the Cleveland harbour patrol caught our operatives in the midst of the crime. Words could not explain why there were dozens of ammo chests and carabines on an unmarked vessel and it didn't take long until the boat was brought back to shore and our agents locked behind bars."
newengland.53.a:0 "Change the course of the routes, we can not stop the operation!"
newengland.53.b:0 "It's too risky, we should focus on the refugee program."

newengland.54.t:0 ""Jack" the Doberman"
newengland.54.d:0 "As man falls back into his usual routine of killing his neighbours, the animal world is not spared from the violence either. A happy story however emerged from Connecticut where a young Doberman, ironically enough named Jack, was able to stop militia agents from blowing up a bomb in Hartford.\n\nThe dog was training in cooperation with the Connecticut National Guard when his patrol spotted the agents who promptly tried to escape from capture. With the courage of a true American, the little dog immediately ran after them and pulled one of the two men down leading to his capture. This man later turned out to be none other than Paul Rashford, a target long sought after by the Hartford Police Department for his implication in the riots only a few months earlier and who seems to have established a whole network of operatives in Connecticut.\n\nWhilst his capture by no means marks the end of the socialist threat in the state, 'Jack' has dealt a heavy blow to their leadership."
newengland.54.a:0 "We express our thanks to this good boy!"

newengland.55.t:0 "Refugees from the CSA"
newengland.55.d:0 "The horrors of war keep raging in [CSA.GetNameDef] and the large migratory wave from theirs into our territory seems to know no end. Just as last month, the Underground Railroad has once again led to the successful transfer of thousands of these war refugees into our Safe Harbour."
newengland.55.a:0 "Let us pray the violence will end soon."

#TEX
newengland.56.t:0 "Refugees from the AUS"
newengland.56.d:0 "Although the journey is full of peril and even though bandits and/or criminals stalk the trails from the deep South all the way to Connecticut, thousands still depart on the journey hoping that they may find peace and a protector in our nation."
newengland.56.a:0 "Welcome to New England!"

newengland.57.t:0 "Pelley asserts control in the AUS"
newengland.57.d:0 "It came as no surprise to the people of America that Huey Long served only as a tool for the far more dangerous Pelley. Today the power struggle within the leadership of the Union State finally came to a head as Pelley himself has officially been sworn in as President and has already started to implement his policies of far-reaching racism and his wishes to achieve a White Christian Nation.\n\nIt goes without saying that the response to these events in the Black Belt has been far from welcoming as hundreds of thousands of Afro-American citizens now fear for their future and look North to us in the hopes of finding a safe haven far away from Pelley’s cronies."
newengland.57.a:0 "We have no place for them either!"
newengland.57.b:0 "Install strict refugee quotas and only allow a select few in."
newengland.57.c:0 "In Boston one is not discriminated for the colour of his skin!"

newengland.58.t:0 "Unchecked Migration"
newengland.58.d:0 "What started as a few hundred, rapidly became tens of thousands as Pelley’s anti-black policy has scared the Afro-American citizens northwards into our territory. Border guards are unable to keep up with the increasing amount of refugees and government institutions and relief organisations are struggling to provide shelter and food to those who have lost their home. We need to step in and do so now or we will risk our own nation collapsing under the weight of these people who more often than not have used all their resources to make it to our border.\n\nA hard choice will have to be made between restricting the amount of refugees coming and thus leaving them at the mercy of Pelley’s regime in the South or to let them all freely cross the border and risk straining our own nation. Relief organisations like United America have already denounced certain political figures who have spoken out against the unchecked migration but even they are now realizing that resources are rapidly decreasing, and the flood keeps increasing."
newengland.58.a:0 "Close the Border!"
newengland.58.b:0 "We are the only hope these people have, let them in!"

newengland.59.t:0 "Appointing the New England Poet laureate"
newengland.59.d:0 "The position of Poet laureate has been discussed within state politics for a few years now. A single person to represent the corpus of hundreds of artists against the tide of film and popular music as an art form. The New England congress has decided to create this title along with a re-consecration of the Boston Athenæum as the temporary Library of Congress. The top candidate in the congressional poll is Robert Frost, who exhibits a distinctly New England mastery of modernist poetry. Public polls, however, has shown favour for the pulp fiction writer H.P Lovecraft. Lovecraft has written in the papers that he would accept this award, but not appear in public for the ceremony. The Library of Congress is in a bind."
newengland.59_lovecraft:0 "The position of Poet laureate has been discussed within state politics for a few years now. A single person to represent the corpus of hundreds of artists against the tide of film and popular music as an art form. The New England congress has decided to create this title along with a re-consecration of the Boston Athenæum as the temporary Library of Congress. The Obvious choice is H.P Lovecraft, the leader of our nation that has both thrilled and terrified us with his works. Lovecraft has written in the papers that he does not care whether he receives the award. If not Lovecraft, the head candidate is Robert Frost, who exhibits a distinctly New England mastery of modernist poetry. The Library of Congress is in a bind."
newengland.59.a:0 "Robert Frost, Modernist Master."
newengland.59.b:0 "H.P Lovecraft, the master of horror."

newengland.60.t:0 "Intervention for John Winant"
newengland.60.d:0 "The private life of President Winant is not the proper subject of newspaper gossip, but after today, it is a public issue. President Winant's minders found a loaded gun in his bedroom tonight, and after a panic determined their was no intended assassin. President Winant confessed to his minders that his secret affair with Sarah Churchill ended, and he is distraught over the potential political fallout for indiscretions with a major Canadian politician's daughter. Fortunately, Winston Churchill was very gently notified, and forgave President Winant in person. Winant has decided to take a few days break to recuperate mentally."
newengland.60.a:0 "He just need a few days off."

newengland.61.t:0 "Gerry Campaigns for Mackenzie King"
newengland.61.d:0 "Long before his career in politics, Peter Gerry was a student at Harvard. There, he was tutored by Canadian Deputy Minister of Labor William Lyon King. These lessons had a major impact on Gerry. Now, King is a major Liberal politician whose allies stateside are the Republicans and the Liberals. As a President, Gerry has talked with his advisers about crossing the party line to help his old mentor. This would invariably debase the Democrats, and aid the Liberals in America. "
newengland.61.a:0 "Don't cross party lines!"
newengland.61.b:0 "Gerry can campaign as he pleases."

newengland.62.t:0 "Cocoanut Grove fire traced back to Tobin"
newengland.62.d:0 "A massive fire erupted in the popular Boston nightclub, Cocoanut Grove, leaving almost 500 people dead. Among the victims are several high ranking American immigrants, and the uproar searching for an answer has raced the highest halls of power. It appears that several mid-level Democratic party politicians had taken bribes earlier this month before an inspection. This inspection was independently determined to be insufficient, and the public prosecutor is preparing a case aledging massive conspiracy. This has rocked public support for Democrats across New England."
newengland.62.a:0 "A shame upon the city."

newengland.63.t:0 "Rockefeller Center artifacts recovered, some defaced"
newengland.63.d:0 "Since the abandoning of New York City to the militant unions, Nelson has sought to recover whatever he can from his prized Rockefeller Center. It appears now, that most of the artwork installed in the skyscraper is now for sale, which Nelson took advantage of. When these relics of a peaceful America arrived, we were all ashamed to find them defaced. It appears Diego Rivera, whose murals were rejected for installation, took it upon himself to replace images of Zeus with Marx. Among several other mythological heroes were all strategically replaced with their respective socialist myth-men. These priceless works of art are ruined."
newengland.63.a:0 "I'll get you Rivera, someday!"

newengland.64.t:0 "Canadians apply for West Point"
newengland.64.d:0 "The Class of 1944 has just arrived, and their numbers are far below expectations. As it is still necessary for Senators to recommend prospective young men, the decrease from 100 new cadets to just 14. It has been suggested that we allow Canadian politicians to recommend their young men to West Point. We are in dire need of new officers, and yet at the same time, this time honored tradition ensures that this institution isn't used by foreign powers, much less the Crown."
newengland.64.a:0 "Absolutely not!"
newengland.64.b:0 "We do need the people."

### Freedom Fliers ###
newengland.70.t:0 "Choosing our Propaganda"
newengland.70.d:0 "The "Freedom Fliers" initiative has been activated by our government but there is still much discussion about the content of the dropped messages as the right message could wreak havoc behind their lines but the wrong message could further bolster their resolve.\n\nWhether to strike the civilian population or the armed forces directly also remains a topic for debate as some have argued that the enemy homefront would be more susceptible to our message but a direct strike on their armed forces could lead to a more direct effect."
newengland.70.a:0 "Attempt to disrupt their attack plans with wrong information."
newengland.70.b:0 "Trick their troops in leaving gaps in their defences."
newengland.70.c:0 "Spread uncertainty on their Home Front."
newengland.70.e:0 "Try to demoralise their troops."

newengland.71.t:0 "The Tale of Private Bob 'Daredevil' Rogers"
newengland.71.d:0 "Private Bob had always been a well-known name in the corps of the Freedom Fliers but it was his recent heroic actions above enemy territory that earned him his nickname 'Daredevil'.\n\nSent out with 5 other members of his squadron, he and his compatriots got surprised by an anti air installation that had been placed there after rumours of incursions into their air zone. Bad intel on our part ultimately led to disaster as the entire group of planes was shredded to pieces with only Private Bob and one of his crew mates surviving the crash. Landing deep behind enemy lines and with no way to reach our own positions, the two men took it upon themselves to perform a series of guerilla actions in the region, achieving critical success in hindering enemy supply lines and successfully forcing their command to deploy further troops to the region.\n\nTheir success would however not continue much longer as an attempt to recruit possible sympathizers amidst the civilian population backfired and a setup orchestrated to finally kill the two men led to the death of Bobs fellow soldier and the loss of his right ear.\n\nNow alone, out of ammunition and still with no way to return to base, Bob traveled all the way North to Lake Erie whilst always staying one step ahead of the enemy agents tracking him down.\n\nEmbarking with 50 refugees on a shaky vessel, Bob finally made it back into New York last week. Having been stuck alone with no contact deep behind enemy lines, it took the brave man 50 days to make his way back into our country leaving a trail of sabotage in his wake. Although granted leave by his commanding officers to recover from his adventure, Bob has reportedly already signed up for the next flight claiming that he would do it all over again for his beloved nation."
newengland.71.a:0 "The American nation thanks her son for his service!"

newengland.72.t:0 "Further Expansion of the 'Freedom Fliers'"
newengland.72.d:0 "Recent successes with the Corps have prompted many to question whether the planes should also be used to perform air drops behind enemy lines to supply the resistance cells with weapons and further equipment. Some have argued however that this deviates too far from the original peaceful mission of the Freedom Fliers and that the extra equipment and manpower necessary for the operations might very well be better spend elsewhere."
newengland.72.a:0 "Assign them the resources!"
newengland.72.b:0 "It's too risky."

newengland.73.t:0 "Sabotage on the Bedford Army Air Field"
newengland.73.d:0 "Under cover of darkness and with support from within, foreign operatives have succeeded in causing massive damage to the fighter planes stationed in Bedford. Dozens of planes have been lost or damaged and the hangars have suffered from various small explosions. We have thus far been unable to stop them and there isn't even an answer as to which faction the saboteurs adhere."
newengland.73.a:0 "Are we blind? Deploy the Garrison!"

newengland.80.t:0 "The Yankee Rebellion"
newengland.80.d:0 "While our intention upon occupying New England was to safeguard the locals from the ravages of the American Civil War, it seems many of them have taken exception. Several leaders in Boston have publicly accused Canada of desiring solely to return the area to British rule, to squeeze whatever we can out of the region so that we can return to the Home Isles, and that they would have been better off throwing their lot in with their American brothers and sisters. The fever pitch in the area has reached the point where we may have to reconsider our plan for New England self-government... or face a long period of uprisings."
newengland.80.a:0 "This will amount to nothing."
newengland.80.b:0 "Bah, very well - set up the provisional government."

newengland.85.t:0 "Yankee Rebellion Over"
newengland.85.d:0 "It has taken many months, but it appears the so-called Yankee Rebellion in New England is over. Resistance leaders have either been captured or fled, and the remaining local governments all seem to be on board with the Canadian government - spurred on, one imagines, by the pictures of devastation throughout the rest of America playing across their newspaper pages. We should see no further trouble in the area."
newengland.85.a:0 "Finally!"

newengland.90.t:0 "Rejoining America"
newengland.90.d.forced:0 "Officials arrived today from [From.GetNameDef] to begin negotiations about a peaceful reunion between our government and theirs. There was little time to discuss the matter in Boston, however, as almost instantly a public campaign swept across the country demanding we dissolve the government at once. New England, the public feels, is not a real country - and its government does not have sufficient legitimacy to refuse the [From.GetAdjective] request."
newengland.90.d.choice:0 "Officials arrived today from [From.GetNameDef] to begin negotiations about a peaceful reunion between our government and theirs, now that the civil war is over and the victor decided. There are many who feel that the main purpose of New England's provisional government - to avoid the chaos of the civil war - has been served, and we should become part of America once again. There are others, however, who feel that New England has achieved its own sense of legitimacy. We have a place in the British sphere, and is being a part of [From.GetNameDef] what we truly want? Are they truly the America we remember?"
newengland.90.a:0 "It seems we have no choice but to agree..."
newengland.90.b:0 "We should rejoin America."
newengland.90.c:0 "No, this is not in our best interests."

newengland.91.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap]'s Request"
newengland.91.d:0 "The ambassador from [From.GetNameDef] has met with [Root.GetAdjective] officials and presented their plan: they wish to peacefully reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], effective immediately. Now that the civil war is done, they believe the purpose of New England's provisional government - namely to avoid the chaos and destruction - is also passed. America, they say, must be one once more. There is a mixed reaction within the government, though most agree that [requester.GetNameDef] will not sit idly by should we refuse."
newengland.91.a:0 "Then we wish them well."
newengland.91.b:0 "We agree, if [requester.GetNameDef] joins the Entente."
newengland.91.c:0 "No, we cannot permit that."

newengland.92.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
newengland.92.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed that the provisional government's purpose is done. They hold no claim over the New England region and wish no conflict with [requester.GetNameDef], nor intend to make any demands upon them for New England's return. [From.GetAdjective] forces have begun to leave the area immediately."
newengland.92.a:0 "Wonderful news!"

newengland.93.t:0 "Reunion with New England"
newengland.93.d:0 "Officials from New England delivered the message promptly: they will gladly unite with [Root.GetNameDef] at once. The purpose of their provisional government - to avoid the chaos of the civil war - is now over with, and they look forward to America being whole once again."
newengland.93.a:0 "Excellent!"

newengland.94.t:0 "The Canadian Concern"
newengland.94.d:0 "While the New England government is not a Canadian puppet, it would be false to suggest that it wasn't part of the British Empire - such as it is - and of great concern to the larger Canadian sphere of interest. The Canadian government is willing to allow New England to reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], since the reason for Canada's intervention in the region ended with the civil war, but they are asking that [requester.GetNameDef] join the Entente alliance. This would make up for New England's loss, and also be a way to pay back [CAN.GetNameDef] for saving American lives."
newengland.94.a:0 "We'll see where this goes..."
newengland.94.b:0 "We're fine with that request."
newengland.94.c:0 "No, they have no right to make that demand."

newengland.95.t:0 "[requester.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"

Leaders and statesmen are making their way to Connecticut, hoping to make history with their involvement in the preservation of America. Others, however, see the Convention as more than an opportunity to not reaffirm the Constitution, but a place to make crucial changes to the document to prevent yet another Civil War. These political dissidents have flocked to the immigrant-backed and Quaker-led alliance under Clarence Pickett or Lovecraft’s increasingly militant and outspoken Loyal Coalition. Canadian liberation has given us freedom and isolation from the Second American Civil War. Yet, with the Second Hartford Convention about to begin, the future of New England seems even more uncertain."

newengland.102.t:0 "Lovecraft and the Providence Circle"
newengland.102.d:0 "During the Weltkrieg, untold thousands rushed to the relative safety, stability, and opportunity of America. As the war languished on, immigrants flooded New England, quickly and unexpectedly changing the face of the northeast. With these diverse, new interests came new problems: particularly, nativist resentment. These problems were only compounded by the economic recession that set in after the Kaiserreich began to isolate the United States of America. This discontent was championed by one of New England’s most famous personalities: the celebrity author, Howard Phillips Lovecraft. Lovecraft’s meteoric rise to fame in recent years is based on his tales of weird and diabolical fiction, seen by both fans and critics as giving voice to the xenophobia, economic insecurity, and reactionary instincts of New Englanders.\n\nInitially the darling of Boston Brahmins and New England’s Anglo-Saxon majority, Lovecraft’s work spread like wildfire across the country, turning him into an overnight sensation. The Shadow Over Innsmouth, one of Lovecraft's most famous novellas, deals obliquely with the threats of state conspiracy and invasion, as well as miscegenation and its monstrous consequences. Some of his most ardent followers swear that prophetic, astrological portents can be understood through comprehensive study of his work. To many, Lovecraft may just be another insane writer with less than moderate views, to others he is a prophet that can guide New England to safety. But whatever Lovecraft may be, he is still a shy, reclusive writer, unlikely to take any drastic action. The only ones in New England that wish to see him in power are the extreme Anglophiles. They view Lovecraft as a tool to ensure complete loyalty to Canada. For now, Lovecraft and his small circle of writers stick to Providence and continue on with their lives, only accompanied by small groups of fans and loyalists. "

newengland.103.d:0 "As America spiralled into war, many turned to Alcohol to escape their troubles. The War, the destruction and all the world can be forgotten about by simply taking a sip of various fermented plants. That is the plan. However, in reality people abuse the Devil’s nectar, and use it to commit horrible acts in their drunken rage. As well the productivity of all people decrease as the worker partakes in suds instead of doing their job. So, as Drunkenness ravages New England and the rest of the United States an unexpected force has risen from the dead. Due to the nationwide failure of prohibition, most sane people assumed that the Prohibition Party was dead in the ground; however, is has made a stunning comeback as New England is ravaged by drunkenness. The party now mainly bases itself in New England and is lead by David Leigh Colvin. Colvin believes that all New Englanders must be moral, compassionate, and caring for every man. The party’s main platform is to illegalize the sale and production of Alcohol, as well as prohibiting Pornography, instilling Christian Values into the nation, and helping the American Refugees fleeing from the Civil War. The party’s sudden re-birth has surprised many within New England, but can the party truly return from the dead?"

Pickett has brought the Religious Society of Friends (AKA ‘Quakers’) to the forefront of New English politics by offering unconditional support to immigrants and refugees alike, while working to change the church from a religious institution into an outspoken political party dedicated to international neutrality, pacifism, and Christian charity. Citing the progressive precedent set by the Roosevelt-administration and the teachings of Jesus Christ, Pickett has begun drafting a set of crucial amendments for New England’s Constitution. Deemed the “Appeal to Heaven,” the Quaker platform aims to transform New England into a welfare state that can open its arms to the downtrodden across the shattered American continent."

This, in turn, has resulted in greater competition for fewer jobs between Americans and Immigrants. And Black Monday has only made things worse! The Republicans see immigration as a threat to New England’s stability; introducing alien philosophies like Syndicalism and Catholicism. The Democrats, though normally a conservative party, have benefited from the Irish community as a voter base in the Northeast. The Prohibitionists and the Quakers, to the horror of everyone gathered, have suggested throwing open the doors of New England as a land of Christian charity and opportunity.

While professional soldiery will always present the best defense, some argue that New England needs bodies more than it needs professionals. The Republicans advocate an elite, limited army with Canadian backing, while the Democrats demand widespread conscription to protect against Syndicalism. Colvin’s Prohibitionists, in keeping with their Pacifist beliefs, have proposed a radical idea: complete disarmament and an open hand towards all.

The debate breaking the Democratic-Republican Coalition is whether the new President should be allowed to appoint all new justices, or whether each state should provide a new justice. The Republicans prefer to draft judges from each state. The Democrats favor the old system, likely because they believe their dominance of Massachusetts will allow them to carry the election. The Quaker Alliance and the Prohibitions have proposed a radical new plan of dissolving the Supreme Court and instead relying a completely federalized system of high courts in each state."

It’s most pressing in New England, because many of the delegations are led by state Governors... who until now have had independent authority. If one of their number wins the election, will the rest surrender power to this First Among Equals? The Republicans advocate preserving federalism as New England is only a temporary creation until America is reborn.

The Irish in New England have also begun to take arms, as they believe that the radical Anglophiles will soon drive them out.  These tensions that have been simmering below the surface finally erupted today. When protests erupted in Boston today over the coronation of an Autocratic King. Most New-Englanders have declared Canada and the Windsor’s illegitimate. People have been in an uproar, and violence has been widespread. The largest of these protests have been in Boston, the nation's capital. As the Irish and the England take up arms against each other, Canada desperately tries to bring stability to Nee England, to no avail. And in the end, Canada may have to take sides in what is rapidly becoming a Civil War. If such a war is to occur within New England, Canada has it’s eye on the most radical Anglophiles, those who will ensure Canada’s rule over New England is secure."

This comes as a shock not just to the people of New England, but the world. As Lovecraft’s isolation and paranoia has made it almost impossible for him to achieve any sort of political power. However, something has changed in Lovecraft. Perhaps he knows that he is near death, perhaps his overwhelming hatred of the Irish Catholics drove him. Whatever the case may be, Lovecraft and his allies in the Loyal Coalition march for Boston, the center of the Irish Scourge. There, Lovecraft, and his allies within the Providence Circle are expected to make an address, a prospect that terrifies the timid Lovecraft.

After a sighting, my locals off a highway in Vermont, the X-Brigade and the so-called “Men in Black” were sent to investigate. Upon arrival, they found a might saucer crashed in a nearby valley. The “Men in Black” quickly dispersed the crowd while the X-Brigade secured the surrounding area. But the men soon realized that a coverup was not as easy as expected, and the saucer appeared to be 2-3 times larger than originally estimated. The massive craft was first dug out from the ground, while almost a brigade of loyal National Guard units sworn to secrecy and Providence’s elite guard loaded the craft on to a fleet of heavy trucks and drove it to a secluded location under the dead of night. Once they had housed the craft in a vast hangar, Lovecraft and his closest confidants went to Vermont for a visit to the alien craft. The question now on everyone’s mind is what to do with the craft.

Nothing could make anything other than a dent. As they grew more desperate, they resorted to firing artillery shells at the craft in the hopes of breaking it open. Their mighty technology might have kept us off them for a while, but we eventually managed to pull through. As we managed to get inside, we found the bodies of the alien captains, as well as a treasure-trove of technology never seen before by mankind. With these new mighty weapons on our side, we can accomplish anything under the sun ... "

And with his iron grip on the government, he has authorized the creation of a special branch within Delta Green specially dedicated to the paranormal and spiritual. With this new branch, we will delve into the vast depths of the unknown. The vast unknown of the afterlife will finally be explored, and the secrets of life and death will finally be revealed. While some in Lovecraft’s government may not be happy with this “Waste of Tax Money”, their opinions do not matter to Lovecraft. His word is law, and nobody dare say otherwise. "

While we have shattered the old vestiges of religion and the occult within New England, we have created a dark cultural vacuum that has given birth to a new religion.\n\n Where once stood old Masonic Halls and church circles, now followers of Providence have established their own groups that aim to study and codify cosmicism; Lovecraft’s principle philosophy. Rather than the naïve platitudes of the old order, cosmicism states that there is no recognizable divine presence such as a god in the universe, and that humans are particularly insignificant in the larger scheme of intergalactic existence. There is no higher purpose, nor grand notions of what we could conventionally call good or evil. There is only the infinite futility of existence, a fragile and delicate flash in the pan of a dark and uncaring universe barely registered by the cosmic gods that dwell beyond our perception and shape our reality through hypergeometry. To a student of cosmicism, these beings are not simply fantasy but a statistical inevitability given the infinite and terrifying scale of the universe."

Others, however, have learned to rage against this miserable reality. If there is no loving god defending humanity from the alien horrors beyond space and time, then there is at least one man that stands against the forces of chaos on Earth and gives humanity meaning. Providence, the godhead, shall stand as a symbol against the forces that threaten civilization and humankind.  With more and more practitioners joining each side with every passing day, it is unclear which group will come to dominate the cosmicist schism. "

And after firstly being denied her wishes, she enlisted within the auxiliary motorized forces. She quickly took to her new position, leaving most of her noble status at home. Her skill in driving and repairing motor vehicles earned her a position in her brigade, and quickly rose through the ranks as her commanding officers died in the war. Her rapid rise through the military command structure may have been aided by her noble status, but her own hard work and skills gained her position. She has now risen to the position of General, something unheard of for a woman in modern New England. Her specialty is in Motorized forces, and with her in a commanding position her focus will be on Trucks and other motor forces."

However, the New English Noble Families are not true blood aristocrats at the moment. But, there is a solution to the problem of nobility. Marriages between the various exiles Windsors and the Noble Astors, Kennedys and Vanderbilts. With these marriages, the New English elite is truly noble, and worthy by blood of the highest positions in society. As well, the various Dukes, Earls and other British Nobility who lost their lands in the British Revolution have gained a new noble status within New England.

And today, the people took to the streets to protest the laws against Prohibition. All around the Nation workers and other citizens staged mass walkouts, effectively grinding the nation to a halt. Soon enough police were deployed across the nation to manage the strike and disperse the protesters. However, protesters across the nation refused to disperse until the laws are reversed. Within time the police forcefully dispersed the protests across the nation, resulting in battles on the streets between Police and Protesters. With the Riots engulfing New England, it has become clear that these prohibition laws are as unpopular with the common man as it was before."

newengland.151.d:0 "As our crackdown on alcohol increases, so does the attempts to subvert our laws. One such method of underground alcoholism is speakeasies, which are Bars that operate away from our laws. These establishments are kept highly secret by the locals and the people who run them; and traditionally serve liquor that is either smuggled in or brewed on-site. This of course is nothing new. During the first era of prohibition in the United States speakeasies became the norm; so, we have experience in dealing with these elicit centers of sin and drunkenness. However, as Bar Culture dies down so does the revenue they produce, as the Alcohol served in speakeasies is not being taxed in any way by the government. But, the money made on immoral practices is of no concern to us; and with targeted operations speakeasy culture will soon be no more. "

Industrial Alcohols used in paint, fuels, cleaning products, solvent and medical supplies have all been re-distilled to be turned into a drinkable product. However, we can deter people from these practices by rendering these alcohols un-drinkable. In response to this, our current government has required all makers of industrial alcohols to denaturatie their product. This process of denaturing the alcohol has put in their alcohol deadly ingredients. Toxic ingredients, such as kerosene ,brucine, gasoline, benzene, cadmium, iodine, zinc, mercury salts, nicotine, ether, formaldehyde, chloroform, camphor, carbolic acid, quinine, acetone and other poisonous ingredients are being put into their product to render it in-consumable. The government hopes that poisoning the industrial alcohols will be the ultimate deterrent against alcoholism, and if we receive backlash from the people, we can simply cover our tracks and blame it on booze tainted with metals and other impurities.

According to the Washingtonians these letters proved their point but are now lost to time. After an extensive investigation, the local fire chief found unusual burn patterns that suggest Arson. Fingers were pointed originally at well-known arsonist Robert Dale Segee, however fingers began to be pointed to the central government after it was found out that all artifacts except for the supposed letters had been moved from the office just hours before the fire.

While Providences has set the coming age in motion, He is not the be-all-end-all of this world. By employing chaos magic to evoke the power of Lovecraft’s creations, we can tap into collective zeitgeist of war-torn New England to bring his imagined Outer Gods into this world.\n\n Knowingly or unknowing, the written works and political actions of Providence have already stoked the fears and anxieties of the people of New England. Willhelm Reich, the group’s enigmatic leader, believes this terror can be distilled into a powerful spiritual essence known as orgone energy capable of reshaping reality.

This discovery has shaken the internal structure of the intelligence community to its core, and a major rift has formed between X-Brigade and their superiors at Delta Green. Delta Green remains fanatics to Lovecraft’s ambitions to defend civilization at all costs, to the point of destroying any and all vestiges of the paranormal or extraterrestrial. Yet who can deny the thrilling implications, the scientific discovery, and the military applications if we were to further study and cooperate with these visitors from the stars? To that end, a group of twelve high ranking officials from all corners of the government have convened to create Majestic-12, a cabal dedicated to the purpose of investigating and recovering alien spacecraft. The majority of X-Brigade, for their part, have secretly broken  with Delta Green and have become by every meaningful metric an extension of Majestic-12."

newengland.156.d:0 "The eldritch forces that Providence has fought to keep at bay have wormed themselves deeply into the foundation of our movement. The fanatics at Delta Green that would purge all they perceive as unnatural with impunity. The misguided technocrats in Majestic-12 hope to control these forces in secret to instate a New World Order. The cultists in the Esoteric Order of Dagon would let these forces run roughshod over New England, and use their occult studies to bring yet more horrors into our world.\n\n Providence, growing increasingly aloof and out-of-touch with the status of his own officials, has failed to notice this looming threat as large swaths of his government have sworn allegiance to one of the three factions battling for the soul of New England. Where each organization once worked behind the scenes to undermine the other, tensions have now broken out into open acts of violence against each other with agents on all sides quietly targeting their rivals and attempting to purge them from various institutions across the country. Sooner or later, however, a clear victor will emerge as the true power behind Providence."

newengland.157.t:0 "The Shadow Over Innsmouth"
newengland.157.d:0 "When Providence originally began the process of rewriting his novella “Shadow Over Innsmouth” into a more substantial tome, it was merely to satisfy the demand of his followers to expand on its themes and motifs to better immerse the reader in Lovecraft’s world building and philosophy following his break-out success. With his rise to prominence and political dominance however, The Shadow Over Innsmouth has undergone a beautiful and terrifying transformation not unlike that of the Deep Ones of the titular Innsmouth itself. Consisting of two parts, the first half of the book is written from the perspective of the narrator and essentially consists of various curated poems, letters, and speeches previously written by Providence. Several passages are addressed directly to the reader on the nature of New England heritage and narrator’s personal philosophy, who is clearly a stand-in for Providence himself. It is generally understood that this first section exists purely to equip the reader with essential knowledge and build their mental fortitude before the second half.\n\n The story then rapidly unravels into an epic tale and deep dive into the very heart of Lovecraft’s mythos. It is an autobiography, a fabricated story, a description of godhood, equal parts truth and lie, a how-to guide for apotheosis, a profane poem, a holy scripture, an apology for Lovecraft’s actions, a profane gesture to those who'd question his or New England’s legitimacy, and an explanation of how a meek and patient man could rise to such greatness. It is at once a terrifying look into the mind of Providence, a guide on how to become like Him, and an intensely disturbing and immersive story that would take a lifetime to process fully.\n\nWhile weaker minds have been driven to madness by Providence’s magnum opus, those capable of finishing his work without losing themselves emerge fundamentally changed.

newengland.158.t:0 "Only Following Orders?"
newengland.158.d:0 "While Lovecraft’s wisdom is without question among his officers, his penchant for reusing papers has created multiple conflicts. Direct orders from Providence are dispatched to generals on scribbled out legal documents or penciled into the margins of previously sent commands. This has caused the embarrassing effect of troops being unable to interpret Lovecraft’s seemingly nonsensible or contradictory orders due to them being muddled or lost in a sea of scribbles and edits around older messages.

One such action taken has been the creation of so-called “Paranormal Combat Squads” by the brass of the Delta Green. These Paranormal Combat Squads are large brigades of scientists and exorcists who are equipped in dealing with Ghosts, Poltergeists, and other spirits. These Combat Squads nicknamed the “Ghostbusters” can deal with wide-scale paranormal activity, and deal with it quickly, while keeping the public calm and in blissful denial. So far, they have not seen much action; however, the higher-ups in Delta Green hope do use them more often, as the explicit purpose of the organization is to fight the unknown supernatural forces plotting against us.

newengland.160.d:0 "It is always important for New England to have a strong relationship with our Canadian allies, and thusly meetings with Canadian Government officials is the norm. A recent meeting was with Lovecraft and Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to discuss the border and the reclamation of the Home Isles. In this meeting, the two men officially talked Politics, diplomacy and trade between New England and Canada; however, in private the conversation took a different tone. Mackenzie King is a well-known believer in the spiritual and the unknown and has taken a particular liking to Lovecraft’s spiritualism and works. And in private, the conversation shifted from the political, to the paranormal and spiritual. Lovecraft and King talked at great lengths about spirits, ghosts and other paranormal occurrences. Rumor even had it that King and Lovecraft held a Seance to communicate with the spirit of the late King George V to ask him for guidance on reclaiming the home isles. So, even if the two may not agree with Politics, their belief in the unknown may strengthen the two nation’s bond in these trying times"

NEE_LESLIE_GROVES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 17, 1896, in Albany, New York State, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Leslie Richard Groves Jr. was born in a family with quite a history in the military, considering his father had served in the Spanish-American War, the Philippines and the Boxer Rebellion. During his late high-school years, Groves started to enroll in courses at the University of Washington, hoping to get an appointment to the United States Military Academy. He got his wish when President Woodrow Wilson himself allowed him to compete for his vacancy, but his grades weren't high enough to be accepted. Instead, Groves joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the meantime while he prepared to retake West Point's entrance exam. In 1916, he took the entrance exam again, and was accepted, visiting the European battlefields on an educational tour in 1919 and graduating in 1920 as a second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers, thanks to his experience in MIT. He was posted with the 4th Engineer corps stationed at Camp Lewis, and would later be moved to Fort Worden, where he'd meet his future wife, Grace Wilson. In late 1922, he was posted in Hawaii with the 3rd Engineer corps at the Schofield Barracks, where he earned a commendation for helping construct a trail from Kahuku to Pupukea. He would be assigned several times, becoming commander of Company D of the 1st Engineer Battalion, helping during the New England flood of 1927, being sent to Nicaragua in 1929 to conduct surveys for the construction of the Nicaragua Canal, and he being assigned to look over Nicaragua's water supply after the 1931 earthquake. It was upon his return to a shattered United States that he gained his last promotions, rising to the rank of Field Marshall in New England, mainly due to the sheer lack of capable staff in the region.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- A brilliant engineer, he has been following closely the development of Nuclear Fission technology keeping regular contact with Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner."

He'd return to Vermont in September, but some time after returning to his university he signed up for the Marine Corps Reserve. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on October 1917, and would be promoted to first lieutenant in June 1920. He later signed up for the Naval Air Station Pensacola, and earned his gold wings as a naval aviator in 1922. He was later stationed in Guam, where received training on semi-tropical environments and upon returning to the US in 1925, he'd take an advanced aviation tactics course at Kelly Field, Texas. He'd later be sent to Nicaragua to fight against the Sandinista forces, and would return to the United States by late 1929. He has since then become the Coach and captain of the Marine corps National Rifle and Pistol teams, managing to win both the 1935 and 1936 tournaments, despite several interruptions due to the growing social unrest. He was finally promoted to Major in February 1936, and assigned to Philadelphia. With the collapse of the Union into civil war, Merritt hardly managed to reach New England before armies closed down the border towards New England. His experience and fame have granted him an early promotion to the rank of Brigadier General.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Apathetic to politics."
NEE_MARK_CLARK_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 1, 1896, in Sackets Harbour, New York State, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Mark Wayne Clark was born into a family with a great military history. His grandfather was George Rogers Clark, a military general from the times of the American Revolution, and is the cousin of Army General George Marshall. He joined the United States Military Academy at West Point when he was just 17, in 1913, but unfortunately lost time in his career due to his constant illness. In his time in West Point, he met and befriended Dwight Eisenhower, and Clark graduated in April 1917 alongside Matthew Ridgway and J. Lawton Collins as a second lieutenant. Like his grandfather, he chose to serve in the Infantry corps where he was assigned to the 11th Infantry Regiment. He'd later serve in a variety of staff and training roles, gaining the rank of First Lieutenant in 1921, the rank of Captain in 1925 after completing the professional officer course at the US Army Infantry School, and reached rank of Major in 1933 after being assigned as the training instructor of the Indiana Army National Guard. He served as the deputy commander of the Civilian Conservation Corps district in Omaha, Nebraska while doing courses at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School where he would meet old classmates like Matthew Ridgway once more, as well as meeting Walter Bedell Smith and Geoffrey Keyes, with whom he had a cordial relationship. As the internal situation deteriorated, Clark was on leave in New York, and when hostilities broke out, he moved to New England looking for safety. With the lack of capable staff, Clark has been hastily promoted to Brigadier General, where he'll now have to oversee the creation of a new army.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- While his loyalty is unquestioned, his friendship with now enemy Generals have raised concerns that General Clark will be unable to do his duty when the time comes to face them openly on the battlefield."
NEE_GEORGE_KENNEY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 6, 1889, in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Churchill Kenney entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1907 where he followed a course in civil engineering. He never completed his studies, as his father abandoned his family and he was forced to work in order to sustain his family. He later enlisted as a flying cadet for the Aviation section of the US Signal Corps. He was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the 5th of November of 1917 and would wouldn't be promoted until 1921 after taking a course at the Air Service Engineering School of Dayton, Ohio. He became Air Service Inspector of the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company. In 1926, Kenney became a student at the Air Corps Tactical School, at Langley Field, Virginia, where he became increasingly interested in the combined used of the air force and the army to coordinate deadly attacks. In September 1932, Kenney entered the Army War College in Washington D.C. where he joined one of several committees studying Weltkrieg battles, where he became an expert on the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes, and began working on what came to be known as the War Plan Orange. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in March 1935, and was assigned to the Infantry School at Fort Benning, in Georgia. However, seeing the buildup to the civil war from the Longist South, Kenney was certain that hostilities were about to break out so he prepared an escape plane with a group of loyalists, and decided to escape northwards as soon as hostilities broke out. Despite all odds, the plane managed to reach New England unscathed, and Kenney has joined the New England General Staff to provide for their defence any way he cans."

He became an infantry and cavalry instructor in 1921, and would gain valuable experience working as an attaché on China between 1928 and 1932, reaching the rank of Captain upon his return.
