Rotha grinned then jumped onto him and began to squish his neck between her thighs, “Can i assume control of your entire government?” she pleaded. “No! this is my commune! i built all of this!” he cried. “Awww, Pretty Please?” she said with sad puppy dog eyes, “NO!” he gasped. “aww alright” she quietly said as she tightened her thighs and his neck, eventually he began to lose his breath"
