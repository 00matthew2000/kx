antcommune.1.a:0 "...What have I done!?"

antcommune.2.t:0 "The Revolution From The South"

antcommune.6.d:0 "[IM NOT DONE] It gets cold and lonely down here in the Antarctic Wastes, especially if you're Leon Trotsky. But things might be getting better, Trotsky met a girl while raiding for supplies in Patagonia. She was so marvelous, Trotsky almost got shot because he couldn't stop staring at her. When he offered her a place to stay in Antarctica, he almost collapsed when she agreed. Since then, they have never been apart, always staring at the frozen wastes from the Camps, catching seal together and cleaning the ice off each other."
antcommune.6.a:0 "How romantic!"
antcommune.6.b:0 "Look, it was just a one night stand"

antcommune.7.t:0 "An odd request"
antcommune.7.d:0 "Trotsky was sitting in his camp, tending to his Frostbite when the love of his life came in. “Hey Hon?” she said quietly, “I got something to ask”. “Go right ahead!” Trotsky said with a cheery grin on his face, still attending to his Frostbite and staring at his love. Rotha grinned then jumped onto him and began to squish his neck between her thighs, “Can i assume control of your entire government?” she pleaded. “No! this is my commune! i built all of this!” he cried. “Awww, Pretty Please?” she said with sad puppy dog eyes, “NO!” he gasped. “aww alright” she quietly said as she tightened her thighs and his neck, eventually he began to lose his breath"
