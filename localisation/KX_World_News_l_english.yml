worldnews.500.d:0 "It has been more than 30 years since Spanish-American War, which caused the fall of the Spanish Empire outside of Africa. Now, that has changed. The Carlist forces have put down many foes in their efforts to revive the empire. From Iberia, to France, Italy, Morocco, and even Asia, Carlist forces have marched everywhere to support their allies in the Mediterranean Bloc, and their own interests. Madrid has sent a international message to every European nation stating the rebirth of the Spanish Empire."

worldnews.14.t:2 "Charles Curtis Elected President of the USA"
worldnews.14.d:2 "Despite the massive instability rampant in the nation ever since the Great Depression in 1925, the presidential elections went forward, and the voting results are clear - the Republican candidate Charles Curtis is the 32nd President of the United States.\n\nDespite his advanced age, Curtis mustered the health to run for President in this tough time for America, and his platform is focused on negotiation and reconcillation with the CSA and AFP. He has already opened talks with them, but can he really satisfy two opposing militants at once?"

worldnews.22.t:2 "Bill Haywood Elected President of the USA"
worldnews.22.d:2 "Despite the massive instability rampant in the nation ever since the Great Depression in 1925, the presidential elections went forward, and the voting results are clear - Bill Haywood of the Socialist Party of America is the 31st President of the United States.\n\nBill Haywood turned into a savvy political operator during his time in Russia, and is a dedicated proponent of Syndicalism. This stance has made him many enemies in the American society, but the association of trade unions that he leads remains strong. The AFP already contests the election results, though..."

worldnews.209.t:2 "The Totalist Charter"
worldnews.209.d:2 "Mussolini, Valois, Oltramare, Jughashvili and other interested parties arrived in Birmingham today to discuss their common ground. It has been agreed that Maximism, Sorelianism and National-Syndicalism all share basic principles of the state's primacy in the socialist struggle, the role of national identity within the state and the importance of a strong central authority to preserve and build socialism. The charter also claims the socialist state is the final stage of human development and that democracy is not necessary to achieve socialism. These statements have drawn great criticisms from other socialist factions, who gave it the name "Totalism" as a play on totalitarian socialism, which has been eagerly accepted by Mosley who added it to the manifesto's name, attributing it to their total commitment to socialism."

worldnews.32.t:2 "Syndicalism Prevails in Ukraine"
worldnews.32.d:2 "After the Weltkrieg, Ukraine became a battleground between the pro-German Hetmanate, the Bolsheviks, Makhno's Free Territory and many other armed groups. The Hetmanate prevailed, but it turned out to be unpopular among the Ukrainians, and after an agricultural crisis and the infamous Black Monday, this hatred reached a breaking point.\n\nThe famous Ukrainian syndicalist leader, Nikita Khrushchev , has led his Red Militias to dissolve the Kingdom and declare the Ukrainian Socialist Republic. Time will tell whether this new entity will endure a German reaction, though, but this victory has strengthened the far-left positions across the Reichspakt."

worldnews.26.t:2 "Annie Kenney Elected Chairman of the TUC"
worldnews.26.d:2 "The 1936 Trade Union Congress in the Union of Britain was made out to be decisive. Long-time Chairman of the TUC, Philip Snowden, declared his resignation, causing the four major factions in the Union - Maximists, Autonomists, Federationists and Congregationists - to butt heads over the position.\n\nAnd as the dust settled, Annie Kenney, the leader of the Congregationists, was elected the new Chairman, or Chairwoman in this case. Kenney is one of only a few female leaders on the planet, and her ideology of a radical feminist and egalitarian approach fit this situation."
worldnews.26.a:2 "Interesting."

worldnews.210.t:2 "The Italian Federation Restored"
worldnews.210.d.tuscwaus:2 "Carried to victory by Austria in their revolt against Gabriele D'Annunzio and the radical ANI, Venetian leaders today announced the restoration of the Italian Federation - the system of government put into place by Austria after the end of the civil war but allowed to lapse in 1929. This time the Consiglio della Federazione Italiana, or Federation Council, will not be led by the Republicans of Milan. Too many, it is said, have lost faith in democracy, and thus the Council will hold full power and be led by a leader of one of the states that comprise the Federation. The Head of the Federation Council is, once more, Grand Duke Pietro Ferdinando of Tuscany. Many believe his return to power is no small coincidence, considering he is a Habsburg and Austrian influence in northern Italy has plainly been restored."

Too many, it is said, have lost faith in democracy, and thus the council will hold full power and be led by a leader of one of the states that comprise the Federation. The Head of the Federation Council is Count Adriano Visconti of Lombardy, a surprising move, since the nation’s Austrian protectors would have preferred the Habsburg Grand Duke of Tuscany. Anti-Austrian sentiment remains high in the country, however, and thus the move was thought safer."

Considering his instrumental role in the revolt against the ANI, many in Italy consider him a national hero."

worldnews.211.t:2 "Dissolution of the Italian Republic"
worldnews.211.d:2 "Successful in their revolt against Gabriele D'Annunzio and the radical ANI, Venetian leaders today announced that they would not restore the Italian Republic, and that instead both it and the new state of Lombardy would go their separate ways as independent nations. Lombardy is currently under military rule, though the government is being assisted by Count Adriano Visconti and most expect he will take the reins as the country's leader. This is unsurprising, considering that faith in democracy has been severely shaken, and the military is concerned that ANI support has not yet been crushed. Whether this move will mean a new status quo of Venetian leadership in the region or leave both nations vulnerable to foreign threats remains to be seen."

worldnews.217.t:2 "ANI Overthrows Italian Government"
worldnews.217.d:2 "After failing in their attempt to take power in the 1937 elections, Gabriele D'Annunzio and the ANI today overthrew the Italian government following months of insurrection and bombings. The republican government's attempts to keep order failed miserably enough that sentiment turned against them, and the ANI pounced on this weakness and gained considerable support within the Italian military. With demonstrations filling the streets, particularly in Venice, Gabriele D'Annunzio today announced that the ANI had taken complete control and would see that the nation remained strong in the face of the syndicalist threat."
