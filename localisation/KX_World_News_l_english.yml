worldnews.500.d:0 "It has been more than 30 years since Spanish-American War, which caused the fall of the Spanish Empire outside of Africa. Now, that has changed. The Carlist forces have put down many foes in their efforts to revive the empire. From Iberia, to France, Italy, Morocco, and even Asia, Carlist forces have marched everywhere to support their allies in the Mediterranean Bloc, and their own interests. Madrid has sent a international message to every European nation stating the rebirth of the Spanish Empire."

worldnews.14.t:2 "Charles Curtis Elected President of the USA"
worldnews.14.d:2 "Despite the massive instability rampant in the nation ever since the Great Depression in 1925, the presidential elections went forward, and the voting results are clear - the Republican candidate Charles Curtis is the 32nd President of the United States.\n\nDespite his advanced age, Curtis mustered the health to run for President in this tough time for America, and his platform is focused on negotiation and reconcillation with the CSA and AFP. He has already opened talks with them, but can he really satisfy two opposing militants at once?"

worldnews.22.d:2 "Despite the massive instability rampant in the nation ever since the Great Depression in 1925, the presidential elections went forward, and the voting results are clear - Bill Haywood of the Socialist Party of America is the 31st President of the United States.\n\nBill Haywood turned into a savvy political operator during his time in Russia, and is a dedicated proponent of Syndicalism.

worldnews.209.t:2 "The Totalist Charter"
worldnews.209.d:2 "Mussolini, Valois, Oltramare, Jughashvili and other interested parties arrived in Birmingham today to discuss their common ground. It has been agreed that Maximism, Sorelianism and National-Syndicalism all share basic principles of the state's primacy in the socialist struggle, the role of national identity within the state and the importance of a strong central authority to preserve and build socialism. The charter also claims the socialist state is the final stage of human development and that democracy is not necessary to achieve socialism. These statements have drawn great criticisms from other socialist factions, who gave it the name "Totalism" as a play on totalitarian socialism, which has been eagerly accepted by Mosley who added it to the manifesto's name, attributing it to their total commitment to socialism."

worldnews.32.t:2 "Syndicalism Prevails in Ukraine"
worldnews.32.d:2 "After the Weltkrieg, Ukraine became a battleground between the pro-German Hetmanate, the Bolsheviks, Makhno's Free Territory and many other armed groups. The Hetmanate prevailed, but it turned out to be unpopular among the Ukrainians, and after an agricultural crisis and the infamous Black Monday, this hatred reached a breaking point.\n\nThe famous Ukrainian syndicalist leader, Nikita Khrushchev , has led his Red Militias to dissolve the Kingdom and declare the Ukrainian Socialist Republic. Time will tell whether this new entity will endure a German reaction, though, but this victory has strengthened the far-left positions across the Reichspakt."
