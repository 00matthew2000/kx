constituents.6.t:0 "National Populists Revolt!"
constituents.6.d:0 "The VF, or Vaterlandisch Front, have tired of the rule of other parties at long last, at party leader Engelbert Dollfuss has authorized an armed insurrection to begin against Austrian authorities in the name of saving the Empire. According to him, the Empire would die as long as these other parties, namely the CS and SDAP, ruled the Empire. He says that the Austrians have failed in their holy duty, to protect the Habsburg Empire from ruin and to keep its people satisfied. A new Austrian state has entered the battle for the Empire."
constituents.6.a:0 "You filthy radicals!"
constituents.6.b:0 "For the new Austria!"

constituents.7.t:0 "Slovenia Revolts!"
constituents.7.d:0 "The Slovenes have long been a thorn in the side of Habsburg interests. Always wishing to be made either one with Illyria or their own nation, the Slovenians, like the many other people of the Empire, have taken up arms against the Habsburg government. A Slovene declaration of independence has been drafted and posted, making Slovenia a free nation... for now."
constituents.7.a:0 "You belong to us!"
constituents.7.b:0 "We're free!"

constituents.8.t:0 "Banat Revolts!"
constituents.8.d:0 "The more tame multiethnic area, the Banat, have united their interests at last. Local politician Otto Roth has declared the independence of a Banatian state, rallying the people under a solid red banner. A significant portion of the population has been mobilized, which is a dangerous gander. We only have more and more problems. We can fight for 120 days."
constituents.8.a:0 "You too?!"
constituents.8.b:0 "Restore peace to the land!"

constituents.9.t:0 "Transylvania Revolts!"
constituents.9.d:0 "Transylvania has always wished to be either a part of Romania or establish their own state. A confused Transylvanian nation has been established, which had problems fighting off Hungarian garrisons but has now established a significant military presence in the area. Any encircled Hungarian loyalists will surely not survive.\nMeanwhile, in Romania, there are reportedly discussions of an alliance or invasion of the fledgling Transylvania. We can fight for 200 days."
constituents.9.a:0 "You belong to us!"
constituents.9.b:0 "Freedom at last!"

constituents.10.t:0 "Nationalist Revolt!"
constituents.10.d:0 "Many Hungarians are still in a bad mood from the thieving of their coastline. An underground nationalist organization has made its first public appearance today, claiming that Hungary is a dead nation, and that only they can revive the dead nation from its grave. Many are attracted to their ideas, their ideas to reclaim the coast, and their spirit to crush all opposition, even the legitimate government. They also boast a significant military presence in a few separated states, which they march outwards in an attempt to link up. We must do something soon."
constituents.10.a:0 "Filthy extremists!"
constituents.10.b:0 "Rise, Hungary!"

constituents.11.t:0 "Socialist Revolt!"
constituents.11.d:0 "The Hungarian syndicalists and socialists, long underground and forgotten, have finally emerged into the light, to thunderous applause by the Internationale and many citizens of the fallen Kingdom of Hungary. They say that the way to prosperity is through the will of the people, and that the Kingdom has failed at the task of satisfying the people's desires. To them, it is now time for revolution, time for the revolution to take Hungary. They have raised a sizeable military around Hungary and have managed to aptly arm them."
constituents.11.a:0 "We'll ruin all you radical reds!"
constituents.11.b:0 "Down with our oppressors!"

constituents.12.t:0 "Slovak Rebellion!"
constituents.12.d:0 "The Slovaks have finally tired of our rule. They have "thrown off their chains," and have conscripted much of the patriotic local Slovak population into fighting for an independent Slovakia.\nWe have managed to retain control of the south that they desire, but who knows how long that'll last... We can fight them for 150 days."
constituents.12.a:0 "You are all Hungarians, fools!"
constituents.12.b:0 "No, we are Slovaks at heart!"

constituents.13.t:0 "Carpatho-Ukraine Declares Independence!"
constituents.13.d:0 "Even Carpatho-Ukraine has tired of our rule, declaring their own state. They intend to join another state soon, but for now they say they shall fight us to the bitter end. Despite being a small nation, they have created an army that is a little big for their land size.We can fight them for 100 days."
constituents.13.a:0 "What the..."
constituents.13.b:0 "Why not?"

constituents.14.t:0 "Socialists rebel!"
constituents.14.d:0 "Underground socialists have always lurked in Austria, but today they have stopped lurking and have started hunting. Having taken control of an unknown area of land, they have raised their weapons in intent to destroy the last vestiges of the monarchy and "impending evil tyranny caused by nationalists." Their army isn't that big, but it's big enough to be a large thorn, if Slovenia wasn't enough of a problem."
constituents.14.a:0 "You stupid SDAP sympathizer!"
constituents.14.b:0 "Down with the black and yellow!"

constituents.15.t:0 "Republican Revolt!"
constituents.15.d:0 "The abolishing of democracy in Illyria has caused outrage. It always has since its death - but today, with the current situation of the Empire, the Republicans have made their move. The Croatian Republic has been declared, and militias have been raised. They intend for the taking of Zagreb, to take over what they deem to be theirs, to liberate it, at least in their eyes. A few members of our government have even exposed themselves as traitors, and have defected to the side of the ramshackle Republic. They get stronger by the day, though..."
constituents.15.a:0 "You are Croatian, though?!"
constituents.15.b:0 "The government is a failure!"

constituents.16.t:0 "Socialist Revolt!"
constituents.16.d:0 "Underground socialists have always lurked in Illyria, but today they have stopped lurking and have started hunting. Having taken control of an unknown area of land, they have raised their weapons in intent to destroy the last vestiges of the state and "impending evil tyranny caused by nationalists."

constituents.17.t:0 "Bosnia Declares Independence"
constituents.17.d:0 "The Bosnians have forever been bitter since 1908, when we took them from the ill Ottoman Empire. They are furious, and their people show it. Their people rise more and more every day, and soon they intend to be arriving in Zagreb to burn it to the ground. They have no remorse for any actions, for any of the death they cause. Bosnia lives again."
constituents.17.a:0 "You won't escape 1908!"
constituents.17.b:0 "Goodbye at last, tyrant!"

constituents.18.t:0 "A Serb State in Bosnia"
constituents.18.d:0 "The Bosnian Serbs seem to have wished of their own state in secret, for today they have defied the Bosniaks and declared their own nation, Republika Srpska. Srpska intends for the routing of all enemy armies, and the creation of a Bosnian Serb state, which may or may not unite with Serbia. They have no idea where they will go from here though, it seems, but their military is emboldened by the day."
constituents.18.a:0 "Serbia won't save you!"
constituents.18.b:0 "Glory to the Eternal People!"

constituents.19.t:0 "Montenegro Revolts!"
constituents.19.d:0 "Montenegro too has been left with a bad taste in their mouth after its defeat in the Weltkrieg. A separate Kingdom of Montenegro was created today, with the intentions of the routing of all Illyrian presence and for their own establishment to be erected in its place. They will fight fiercely..."
constituents.19.a:0 "Nobody will be there!"
constituents.19.b:0 "We're ready for you, Illyrian!"

constituents.20.t:0 "Czech Republicans Revolt"
constituents.20.d:0 "Czech republicans have rose in revolt of the "tyrannical" government. I actually have no idea how this event is even triggering for you... so until someone can get it it will remain like this. Sorry!"
constituents.20.a:0 "You traitors!"
constituents.20.b:0 "Our allegiance is to a republic!"

constituents.21.t:0 "West Ukraine Declares Independence!"
constituents.21.d:0 "The Ukrainians in Galicia have stopped cooperating with the Poles of Galicia, and thus war has erupted, between Galicia and the new West Ukraine, who seek for either unification with Ukraine or the establishment of a nation of their own, a second Ukrainian state. Quite the problem indeed..."
constituents.21.a:0 "Wh... You'll regret that!"
constituents.21.b:0 "We're on our own now."

constituents.22.t:0 "Bukovina Rebels!"
constituents.22.d:0 "The Bukovinians stopped responding to all attempts to reach them a few hours ago, and only now has it become apparent of their traitorous actions. Declaring a Duchy of Bukovina, they may either unite with Romania or stake their own course in world affairs. Whatever happens, hopefully they will be known as traitors and cowards... The only thing that prevents us from reaching these nefarious militants is West Ukraine!"

The victim was an Austrian, dead by an unknown assailant, but the corpse was found charred and smashed. It seems the murderer was absolutely furious, but nobody has any idea who could have done it."
constituents.25.a:0 "How terrible!"

constituents.26.t:0 "Organized protests hit the nation!"
constituents.26.d:0 "Protests against the Kaiser have risen again, and the Empire in general. Protests against the oligarchy the Germans have over the Empire. They claim that the Germans have no idea what is best for the Empire, and that they will be the downfall of the Austrian Empire. Spurious claims, to say the least, but let's tread carefully.\nOn another note, what is the official policy towards such idiotic protests?"
