POLITICS_BIRCH_DESC:0"Stephen Birch presided over Kennecott Copper, the Alaska based, largest copper production company in America. The Alaskan Syndicate member resigned as President of Kennecott in 1933, although he kept control of other mineral and transportation companies centered in Alaska.

POLITICS_GUGGENHEIM_DESC:0"Simon Guggenheim of the Jewish descended Guggenheim Family is a rich Capitalist with with significant control over Alaska’s copper, salmon, and transportation industries. His Alaskan Syndicate, made to monopolize Alaskan resources and gain political power over its people, rivals Alaska’s own Legislation on terms of political pull.

POLITICS_JAMES_WICKERSHAM_DESC:0"James Wickersham served as Alaskan District Judge in the years 1900 - 1908, where he ran for a spot as territorial representative to the US House of Reps, a position he held until 1933. Although technically a Republican, his personal war with the Alaskan Syndicate’s cruelly capitalistic business methods caused him to seek heavy Federal assistance for Alaska. Ultimately at the end of his terms, his pushes against the Syndicate were not assisted by the rest of the Legislation, and the situation had only gotten worse in time. Angered by the Legislations refusal to crack down on the Barons, Wickersham wants for Alaska a land where the people’s work cannot be tarnished by greedy businessmen and capitalists, but his left leaning supporters yearn for a more red set of ideals"

POLITICS_DIMOND_DESC:0"Anthony Dimond of New York came to Alaska in 1905 as a prospector. In his major Political years, he served as a US Commissioner, an Assistant Attorney, a Mayor, and a Senator, all based in Alaska. Dimond’s heavy portfolio shows him as a clear, intelligent man whose feats are only contested by his brutal anti-semetism. This trait has caused him to be at odds with the Jewish-descended Guggenheim’s, and Dimond holds a certain disdain for large and wealthy groups who attempt to lead average people"
POLITICS_SUTHERLAND_DESC:0"An Alaskan Representative to the US House of Reps from 1921 to 1931, “Fighting Dan’s” dog sled campaigning and aircraft rescuing career seemed to end after he moved to Pennsylvania.

POLITICS_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "The National Committee of State. Such a boring name, given to such a ... Interesting group. It is known as the "Shotgun Regency", a committee of the most influential men in Texas. This is not a council designed to benefit the people, it is designed to benefit Texaco. The council is not here to stay, it is not something permanent. Rather it is just something to provide the facade of a democratic presence. In reality, the Oil Barons could care less about Democracy"
POLITICS_TORKLID_RIEBER_DESC:0 "Nobody expected Rieber to end up in the place he is today. He was born in Norway, thousands of miles away from our shores. But he worked his way off of the Shores of Norway, to Texas' shores, as he became a sailor. He eventually managed a cargo ship containing Texaco oil, the company he came to manage. And once he rose to Texaco's highest position, he started his crusade against Syndicalism and other leftist groups. He is a strong admirer of Codrenau, and advocates for a state run by corporations. He is also one of the people that helped tear Texas from the United States, he funded the Minutemen, and anti-leftist propaganda. And once Texas left, he established an iron grip over the fledgling state."

He is a man of an iron will, a man of spirit; who is not above making deals with the devil"
POLITICS_JAMES_ALLRED_DESC:0 "Allred has had a... Interesting political carer. He was a Democrat at first, he was an ally of the Establishment. He was a man of the left, father left than his Democratic Base. Once Texas was plunged into chaos, a weary sense grew in Allred, a sense that something was not right in America. As the Texan Independence movement grew, instead of shutting down the debate, he opened it. He eventually gained the traction to hold a referendum, one that overwhelmingly passed. He saw Washington fail at defending his home, he saw them sell Texas' future. And once the momentum was present, he abandoned the Federal Government, and became the leader of a reborn Republic. He is currently the leader of the Texas Independence Party, but he is barley holding on to power"
POLITICS_WL_ODANIEL_DESC:0 "A songwriter, that forged a path through the complex political system, and finally defeating the long-time leader of a reborn nation and becoming President of Texas while the U.S collapses around him. Sounds crazy, doesn’t it... Wilbert Lee "Pappy" O'Daniel is that story, in the 20's he was a songwriter; writing popular songs like "Beautiful Texas". He became extremely popular, to the point where he became a household name. His popularity soared, as he denounced the Federal Government in Texas' time of crisis.

As leader, he supports business, pensions for seniors and Tax Cuts, as well as speaking over the radio; something that has energized the nation"

POLITICS_JAMES_BURNHAM_DESC:0 "A fellow-travelor of the far-left ever since he's been politically active, James Burnham began as a starry-eyed supporter of the Russian Revolution before seeing it quashed. His hope in socialism was revitalized with the British and French Revolutions only to witness the Empires of old not only persist but reform themselves internally. Influenced by French Sorelianism and his personal readings of Machiavelli he has come to view politics as largely a power struggle between competing elites with revolutions only temporarily succeeding in nations that failed to modernize their elite into a "Managerialist" class of technocratic minds as opposed to the aristocrats and capitalists of old. Viewing imperialist expansion as an inevitable consequence of their growing bureaucracies and promotion of national myths Burnham is dismayed by what he views as the infighting and factionalism promoted by traditional syndicalism and views socialism's only hope as being the promotion of a highly technocratic-oriented leadership alongside an American Nationalism that shall glue the nation together where socialism can not. His American Worker's Party (AWP) is currently a combination of his followers who de facto left the SPA's Federalist faction with him, Lovestoneites, national-syndicalists and Howard Scott's Technocratic Movement. While the latter has questionable loyalties to socialism he has promised to place them in charge of the economy in return for allowing him to run the political sphere in the power-oriented method he views as necessary."
POLITICS_FERDINANDO_DESC:0 "Ferdinand of Bourbon-Two Sicilies' last 20 years have been troubled, as the relative tranquility of exile he lived in since his birth in 1869 was replaced with the responsibilities of being a monarch of a sovereign nation and the leader of the Italian Federation, at least in an interim fashion. Having arrived well after the civil war in Italy was concluded, his position was always fragile, and he himself knows he is little more than a puppet in the great game of Sicilian, Italian and global politics at large, as his presence legitimizes the Kingdom internationally and allows it to remain aligned with the powers that be in Europe, having effectively kept large scale syndicalist offensives at bay. His rule, while not without political issues, came after 6 years of war and strife, and he tries his utmost to ensure that he takes personal credit for this peace and relative prosperity. While he traditionally has kept himself away from political affairs, as he is aware of the fragility of the peace he and many work to mantain, the matter of the constant syndicalist threat, especially towards His Holiness in Rome, and his lack of a male heir, weigh heavily on him. The creeping feeling of powerlessness, even now as he is a monarch, makes him more prone to overtures by radical monarchists than even he himself realizes."
POLITICS_JULIUS_EVOLA_DESC:0 "Baron Julius Evola is one of the most controversial political philosophers in Europe and, perhaps, the world. Devoting himself to an ideology that has been named "Radical Traditionalism", "Legionarism" and "Ultra-Rightism", Evola believes that modern society is in the age that Hinduism refers to as "Kali Yuga", or an age of darkess and choas. Admiring warrior-societies such as the Teutonic Knights, Roman Empire and Ancient Sparta, Evola claims that there is a Western tradition that must be revived to stand against the consumerism found in both capitalism and socialism. As such he is a fierce spiritualist and anti-materialist whom advocates forms of asceticism, holds the current Catholic Church in contempt for meekness and holds supernatural beliefs. His views would have stayed fringe had foreign powers not both passively propped up the unpopular Bourbon dynasty and exiled the House of Savoy, Evola's utter denunciation of which has won him support among nobles in exile including, apparently, the former King of Italy himself, whom Evola ultimately seeks to make the supreme power of the state."
POLITICS_VICTOR_EMMANUEL_III_DESC:0 "The Former King of Italy and Head of the main branch of the House of Savoy has returned from his long exile to find an army of fanatical monarchists at his disposal. He is utterly an admirer of Julius Evola, now his High Chancellor, for making the seemingly impossible come true and bringing to life his aspirations. It helps that the King is also known to harbor reactionary beliefs which grow increasingly right-wing with Evola at his side and the Socialist enemy in the north. He hopes that he and Legion can accomplish the seemingly impossible and defeat the traditional enemies to his power, the republicans, the socialists and the Catholic Church."
POLITICS_CAPONE_DESC:0"Alphonse Gabriel Capone, known more commonly as “Al Capone”, was born in New York City to Italian immigrants. His upbringing was tough, the streets of Brooklyn shaped his world views whilst his Catholic upbringing taught him that morals matter little in the modern world. Capone understood from a young age that in order to survive you have to be ruthless, the cutthroat world of business carved Capone into a prominent businessman profiteering off prohibition. Bootlegging proved successful and Capone expanded his growing empire into Chicago from where he took over failing businesses wrecked by economic stagnation. He also never forgot his roots and used his newfound wealth to set up soup kitchens for the homeless and provide honest work for the jobless. Despite accusations of involving himself with gangs and all sorts of illegal matters he developed a reputation amongst the working class as a “man of the people”. Capone became a prominent supporter of labour unions, especially the IWW, when the Second Civil War broke out Capone launched himself into politics. Aligning himself to the Centralist Faction, advocating for union control over all aspects of life he has clashed with anarcho-syndicalists who accuse him of being a potential dictator. Furthermore his gang affiliations have once again struck his credibility, accusations have emerged of Capone using the Chicago Mafia to intimidate political opponents. Now in control of the CSA, this bootlegging businessman turned defender of proletariat must decide the future of America and socialism."
POLITICS_AOG_BOARD_DESC:0"The Board of Directors is a council of the largest businesses in the AOG. They meet monthly to discuss the policy of the nation and decide on the future of the Concessions. While legally the board of directors is representative of all companies within the AOG, Krupp has the lines-share of influence, and many believe that the Board of Directors to be a complete front for Alfred Felix Alwyn von Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach’s and his company. And despite its vast influence, the Board of Directors is shrouded in deep secrecy, something representative of its elitist nature; but despite it’s secrecy, the power held by the Board of Directors is immeasurable. Even if the Board acting as head of state is a cover for Krupp’s ambitions."
POLITICS_JAMES_CURLEY_DESC:0 "A disaster mitigated by moments of farce or a Northern Huey Long, depending on who you ask. James Michael Curley, Governor of Massachusetts is corrupt as the day is long. Curley served four terms as the Mayor of Boston (one of them while in prison) and was under constant investigation by the Boston Finance Commission. It didn't keep him from being elected governor in 1935. Probably because while he was lining his own pockets, he was also building schools, libraries, parks, roads, and enlarging Boston City Hospital. An Irishman, a Democrat, and a popular Governor, Curley wields significant influence in New England."
POLITICS_AMANULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "After the murder of his father by a dominionist assassin, Amanullah has been filled with a deep-seated hatred for the British. For too long has mighty Afghanistan been forced to hide in the shade of the British Raj. For too long has the King of the God-granted Kingdom of Afghanistan and its dependencies been regarded as the leader of a second-rate power. Only through blood and steel shall the Afghan people carve their place in the Sun from the corpse of the British Empire, just as the Germans did."
POLITICS_HABIBULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "Habibullah's reign has thus far been marked by reforms and attempts to modernize his country by working to bring modern medicine and other technology to Afghanistan. In 1903, Habibullah founded the Habibia school as well as a military academy. He also worked to put in place progressive reforms in his country. He instituted various legal reforms and repealed many of the harshest criminal penalties. Though at first strictly maintaining the country's neutrality in World War I, he would eventually cave after strenuous efforts by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and a German military mission (the Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition) to enlist Afghanistan on its side. His declaration of the 4th Anglo-Afghan War would see an influx of supplies from the German Empire and relations between the two nations have remained positive since."
POLITICS_KALAKANI_DESC:0 "Amir Habibullah was born in 1891 in the village of Kalakan, north of Kabul. An ethnic Tajik, his father was named Aminullah and delivered water to people's homes. During his adolescence, Kalakani ventured out of his village and traveled to the city of Kabul. In the south, he met an old Sufi who told the young Habibullah that he would become king one day. Later, he returned to Kabul and joined Amanullah Khan's army. Kalakani would be a highwayman who mostly stole from the wealthy for some time. Only a few months after the disastrous 5th Anglo-Afghan War, Kalakani and his friends began to attack the unprotected Kabul from the north. The revolt caught steam and the country was thrown into a civil war. Wild tribesmen from Waziristan had the southern areas of Kabul surrounded, and Kalakāni's forces moved into the heart of Kabul from the north, taking the capital. He finally had become King."
POLITICS_LOVECRAFT_DESC:0 "H.P. Lovecraft, born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1890, is perhaps one of the most mysterious and controversial figures of the 20th century. His father dying when he was 8, his mother dying of the Spanish Flu in late 1918, and Lovecraft suffering from a plethora of health issues his entire life have led Lovecraft into a search for truth and deep meaning, which he channeled into his writings. Tales of darkness and horror within resonated strongly with an America reeling from the 1925 market crash. Lovecraft's science fiction gained him a serious audience for his thoughts on politics and philosophy. He rapidly gained an almost cult-like status in his home state of Rhode Island and drew many followers, preaching a dark and otherworldly message about supernatural powers and eldritch beings that are incomprehensible to the human mind. As president of the New England Literary Society, Lovecraft standardized the use of the English language in print, removing what he called 'Americanisms'. When he traveled to England in 1924 to study the English language and attempt to purify it as much as possible, he witnessed the 1925 uprising and grew an acute hatred of Syndicalism. He returned to America in 1930, founded his own newspaper and ran unsuccessfully for governor of Rhode Island. He remained a prominent thought leader and a powerful influence on the minds of New Englanders, although his opponents accuse Lovecraft of being a dangerous man with authoritarian and occultist inclinations."

When the Russian Civil War broke out he led his comrades in battling enemy forces, alongside Grigol the two Georgians became infamous for their efficiency and also brutality. As the war progressed Ioseb fled to Georgia, joining the coalition government and proving himself as an intelligent economic advisor.\n\nAfter launching a coup of his former comrade and declaring himself Chairman of the nation, he now possesses the ability to reshape his country’s destiny under the ideology of Georgian Socialism.

POLITICS_GEORGES_VALOIS_DESC:0 "Born as Alfred-Georges Gressent, to a working-class peasant family in 1878, Georges was invested in politics from an early age. Becoming an adherent to the national-syndicalist teachings of Georges Sorel whilst working as his secretary, however he was not always a man of the left. After publishing political thought directly inspired by his mentor, Sorel, he became an acquaintance of monarchist writer Charles Maurras. Joining Maurras’s movement, Action Française, he developed his ideology of fusing working-class based politics with monarchism. In 1911 he founded the Cercle Proudhon with fellow AF comrades, this group espoused national-syndicalism, integral nationalism and antisemitism whilst rejecting liberal and conservative democracy. Overtime as syndicalist movements evolved throughout France, the Cercle became overtly left-wing whilst maintaining an aggressively nationalist stance on world politics. When the French Civil War broke out, Valois took advantage of the crisis by turning his group into a fully fledged political movement. The Sorelians were born, disowning any previous reactionary views, Valois and his comrades took to streets of a broken France to demand the destruction of the French Third Republic.\n\n Now he has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Valois advocates the unification of the chairmanships of the Bourse Générale du Travail and Comité de Salut Public, a precursor in the eyes of many Communards, to tyranny. He has also advocated for vengeance against Germany and the reclamation of lost French territory."
POLITICS_MARCEL_DEAT_DESC:0 "Marcel Déat was born in 1894 to a modest family, in his youth he excelled at his studies and became involved in left-wing politics. A student of Radical politician Émile Chartier he joined the SFIO,  however this political stint came to end when the Weltkrieg broke out. A staunch patriot he enlisted in the French Army and saw active duty, earning the Legion of Honour and five bravery citations. The Weltkrieg shaped his political views, forging a deep hatred for Germany and the French elite who he saw as failing the nation. During the lead up the French Civil War, Déat has positioned himself to the right of the socialist movement, advocating for an authoritarian anti-capitalist state. His work was published by Valois who had taken interest in Déat and the two became fast allies, when the General Strike led to civil conflict Déat declared loyalty to the Sorelans.\n\nRepresenting the ‘Vanguardist’ faction of the Sorelians, Déat has proved himself to be an opportunist first, and ideologue second. Forging connections with former political enemies and taking action against fellow comrades, Déat has fought his way to the top of the Sorelian leadership. Now in control of the National Worker’s State, Chairman Déat can lead the authoritarian anti-capitalist regime he always envisioned."
POLITICS_MARCEL_BUCARD_DESC:0 "Many things Marcel Bucard has been called over the years. Syndicalist, Anti-semite, Nationalist, Worker. Beginning life as the son of a butcher in Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, Marcel Bucard initially studied to become a Catholic Priest. This all changed however with the outbreak of the Weltkrieg where he patriotically signed up to fight off the German horde in defense of the French nation rising through the ranks and winning admiration for fellow french patriots and friends in the trenches. No matter how hard he fought however the horrors of the war cemented his personal hatred for Germany and its mistreatment of the French people. Originally a reactionary, the Weltkrieg provided him with a deep hatred for the French upper-class who he saw as cowards for surrendering to the Germans. The revolutionary period that swept France saw the Bankers, Liberals, Capitalists, the exploiters of the French nation abandon it and flee with the riches of its people. Countering this was of the utmost personal importance to Bucard who joined Valois’s Sorelians, eventually taking leadership of his own faction, the ‘Ultranationalist-Syndicalists’. Giving speeches towards crowds of disenfranchised French patriots against 'Ruthless banking clans' and their 'Liberal lapdogs' he easily recruited among the galvanized Weltkrieg veterans.\n\nNow in control as the Chief of the National Worker’s State, Bucard sees the destruction of the German Empire as his main objective. To him, the superior French proletariat have smashed the chains of their masters and can no longer be defeated by any force!"
POLITICS_MAURICE_THOREZ_DESC:0 "Maurice Thorez was born in Pas-de-Calais, France, 28 April 1900. Becoming a coal miner at the young age of 12, he would later join the French Section of the Workers' International at the age of 19. His time in the SFIO introduced him to Marxist thought, he became enamoured by communist thought and was a staunch supporter of the Bolshevik uprising in Russia. The failure of the Bolsheviks developed his belief that they were not pure enough, so Thorez the Bolshevik leaders had failed both Lenin and Marx. Inspired by the revolutionaries in Russia, Thorez took up arms during the French Civil War, although declaring himself a syndicalist his true intentions were to convert the masses to Communism. A charismatic leader, many flocked to his ranks and once the revolutionaries had solidified control and established the Commune of France he immediately turned his followers against their comrades. Declaring the Commune a bourgeois continuation of the Third Republic, his communist followers who now referred to themselves as the ‘Jacobins’ protested zealously against the CGT. Inspired by both French revolutionary, Maximlien Robespierre and Vladimir Lenin, Thorez was a political outcast who’s failure to secure a seat in the CGT led many to believe he was an irrelevant figure.\n\nThe 1936 CGT elections sent shockwaves through France, Thorez’s Jacobins were victorious and now the outcast has cemented his power. His hatred for syndicalism will undoubtedly result in a great re-shaping of Commune democracy whilst his authoritarian approach to opposition has led many to see Thorez as a new dictator..."
POLITICS_FRENCH_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "With Chairman Valois now dead, power has been vested within the Sorelian Council. Valois never named his successor in the event of his death, therefore to avoid further conflict the Comité de Salut Public was formed. Chaired by Peirre Laval, the council lacks unity with it being split between two competing factions. Valois’s secretary, Marcel Déat leads the Vanguardists whilst commander of the Revolutionary Legion, Marcel Bucard, leads the Ultranational-Syndicalists. With the threat of anarchy looming, can the council unify behind a single leader or will it collapse..."

Laws and authority is enforced by fully autonomous communes which are usually commanded by a worker’s council. However despite this supposed unlimited freedom and abolition of all hierarchies, the most powerful man in the nation is undoubtedly Nestor Makhno. His role as the protector of anarchy allows him command large numbers of Black Guard soldiers who station themselves across the Free Territory. When his men require rest and food the citizens of communes oblige, Makhno chooses to not involve himself in the politics of anarchist communes however it would be unwise to challenge any decision he could make..."
POLITICS_GAMELIN_DESC:0 "Born into a military family, 20 September 1872, Maurice Gustave Gamelin was always destined for military greatness. Entering into the Saint-Cyr Military Academy he graduated first in his class, going on to serve in Tunisia. Serving as attaché to future Marshal of France, General Joseph Joffre, this position provided Gamelin with a solid knowledge of strategic and tactical warfare. During the Weltkrieg he distinguished himself for helping plan the victory at the Battle of the Marne. Quickly being promoted all the way to Brigadier General however with the German offensive of 1918 pushing further and further into France, Gamelin was recalled to Paris. Leading a desperate defence of the capital he held the lines just long enough for a civilian extraction saving countless lives. After the war he maintained a high ranking position in the military, as civil tension escalated he refused to allow politics to sway his loyalty to France. When the syndicalist revolutionaries were successful, Gamelin offered his services to the government and was made Marshal of the Commune of France. This came to an end when the Jacobin regime was declared.\n\nAs the Jacobin rule of tyranny tore France apart, Gamelin realised that his backseat in politics must end. Forging an alliance Léon Blum, a Popular Front backed by the military, has overthrown Thorez’s dictatorship with Gamelin proclaimed as Maréchal. Many now regard Gamelin as the defender of Communard democracy, and saviour of France."
POLITICS_NESTOR_MAKHNO_DESC:0 "Born into a poor peasantry family in Ukraine, 26 October 1888, Nestor Ivanovych Makhno was forced to adapt quickly to a harsh life. Extreme poverty led to him finding work for himself, being employed at a local iron foundry he witnessed the rise of revolutionary anti-Tsarist politics. Having experienced the Tsarist Regime’s brutality himself he joined local anarchists and took part in robberies resulting in his imprisonment. When the Weltkrieg broke out he remained a prisoner, sentenced to death by hanging, this came to end with the Russian Revolution. Being freed he left for Ukraine, forming connections with anarchists he established the ‘Black Army’ to fight against both Ukrainian nationalists and the intervening German forces. When Germany secured its dominance of the nation he fled his homeland for France.\n\n Now, his firebrand denouncement of any and all state-authority has secured his popularity and notability in French politics. Forming the ‘Black Guard’ terrorist organization which has now overthrown the Sorelian regime. With the failures of Ukraine and France, Makhno has been further radicalised by the Illegalists. His radical vision of a nation, and perhaps world, without government of any kind, will likely not come to fruition in the foreseeable future. However his efforts to destroy any remnants of authority in the commune with the establishment of the ‘Free Territory of France’ have so far been successful. These successes may be in vain however, for his personal army of anarchists are the only thing that can prevent France’s neighbours from taking advantage of this chaos..."
POLITICS_ROMMEL_DESC:0"The Kaiser has appointed Generaloberst Erwin Rommel as Mittelafrika’s new Statthalter. During the Weltkreig he served in Italy and was awarded the Pour le Mérite. He Served in the infantry, though he would later come to identify with a much more powerful form of warfare, Armoured Warfare. This however gained him many enemies within the High Command, who wanted to keep Germany practicing more traditional forms of warfare. After he published a renowned book on warfare, the Kaiser sent him to Africa to keep him out of the way of the High Command. However, this only strengthened his position in the high command as his doctrine of armoured warfare was perfectly suited the vast African plains.
